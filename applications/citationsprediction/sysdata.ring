		"Direct detection of bacterial Biofilms on the middle-ear mucosa of children with chronic otitis media",
		"Context Chronic otitis media ( OM) is a common pediatric infectious disease. Previous studies demonstrating that metabolically active bacteria exist in culture-negative pediatric middle-ear effusions and that experimental infection with Haemophilus influenzae in the chinchilla model of otitis media results in the formation of adherent mucosal biofilms suggest that chronic OM may result from a mucosal biofilm infection.Objective To test the hypothesis that chronic OM in humans is biofilm-related.Design, Setting, and Patients Middle-ear mucosa (MEM) biopsy specimens were obtained from 26 children ( mean age, 2.5 [ range, 0.5-14] years) undergoing tympanostomy tube placement for treatment of otitis media with effusion (OME) and recurrent OM and were analyzed using microbiological culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)based diagnostics, direct microscopic examination, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunostaining. Uninfected ( control) MEM specimens were obtained from 3 children and 5 adults undergoing cochlear implantation. Patients were enrolled between February 2004 and April 2005 from a single US tertiary referral otolaryngology practice.Main Outcome Measures Confocal laser scanning microscopic (CLSM) images were obtained from MEM biopsy specimens and were evaluated for biofilm morphology using generic stains and species-specific probes for H influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Effusions, when present, were evaluated by PCR and culture for evidence of pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences and bacterial growth, respectively.Results Of the 26 children undergoing tympanostomy tube placement, 13 (50%) had OME, 20 (77%) had recurrent OM, and 7 (27%) had both diagnoses; 27 of 52 (52%) of the ears had effusions, 24 of 24 effusions were PCR-positive for at least 1 OM pathogen, and 6 (22%) of 27 effusions were culture-positive for any pathogen. Mucosal biofilms were visualized by CLSM on 46 (92%) of 50 MEM specimens from children with OME and recurrent OM using generic and pathogen-specific probes. Biofilms were not observed on 8 control MEM specimens obtained from the patients undergoing cochlear implantation.Conclusion Direct detection of biofilms on MEM biopsy specimens from children with OME and recurrent OM supports the hypothesis that these chronic middle-ear disorders are biofilmrelated."+char(34)+"",

		"The inevitable deterioration in hearing ability that occurs with age-presbycusis-is a multifactorial process that can vary in severity from mild to substantial. Left untreated, presbycusis of a moderate or greater degree affects communication and can contribute to isolation, depression, and, possibly, dementia. These psychological effects are largely reversible with rehabilitative treatment. Comprehensive rehabilitation is widely available but underused because, in part, of social attitudes that undervalue hearing, in addition to the cost and stigma of hearing aids. Remediation of presbycusis is an important contributor to quality of life in geriatric medicine and can include education about communication effectiveness, hearing aids, assistive listening devices, and cochlear implants for severe hearing loss. Primary care physicians should screen and refer their elderly patients for assessment and remediation. Where hearing aids no longer provide benefit, cochlear implantation is the treatment of choice with excellent results even in octogenarians."+char(34)+"",

		"Context Cochlear implantation is a surgical alternative to traditional amplification (hearing aids) that can facilitate spoken language development in young children with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).Objective To prospectively assess spoken language acquisition following cochlear implantation in young children.Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective, longitudinal, and multidimensional assessment of spoken language development over a 3-year period in children who underwent cochlear implantation before 5 years of age (n=188) from 6 US centers and hearing children of similar ages (n=97) from 2 preschools recruited between November 2002 and December 2004. Follow-up completed between November 2005 and May 2008.Main Outcome Measures Performance on measures of spoken language comprehension and expression (Reynell Developmental Language Scales).Results Children undergoing cochlear implantation showed greater improvement in spoken language performance (10.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.6-11.2 points per year in comprehension; 8.4; 95% CI, 7.8-9.0 in expression) than would be predicted by their preimplantation baseline scores (5.4; 95% CI, 4.1-6.7, comprehension; 5.8; 95% CI, 4.6-7.0, expression), although mean scores were not restored to age-appropriate levels after 3 years. Younger age at cochlear implantation was associated with significantly steeper rate increases in comprehension (1.1; 95% CI, 0.5-1.7 points per year younger) and expression (1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.5 points per year younger). Similarly, each 1-year shorter history of hearing deficit was associated with steeper rate increases in comprehension (0.8; 95% CI, 0.2-1.2 points per year shorter) and expression (0.6; 95% CI, 0.2-1.0 points per year shorter). In multivariable analyses, greater residual hearing prior to cochlear implantation, higher ratings of parent-child interactions, and higher socioeconomic status were associated with greater rates of improvement in comprehension and expression.Conclusion The use of cochlear implants in young children was associated with better spoken language learning than would be predicted from their preimplantation scores.

		"A sensitive period for the development of the central auditory system in children with cochlear implants: implications for age of implantation.",
		"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present experiment was to assess the consequences of cochlear implantation at different ages on the development of the human central auditory system.DESIGN: Our measure of the maturity of central auditory pathways was the latency of the P1 cortical auditory evoked potential. Because P1 latencies vary as a function of chronological age, they can be used to infer the maturational status of auditory pathways in congenitally deafened children who regain hearing after being fit with a cochlear implant. We examined the development of P1 response latencies in 104 congenitally deaf children who had been fit with cochlear implants at ages ranging from 1.3 yr to 17.5 yr and three congenitally deaf adults. The independent variable was the duration of deafness before cochlear implantation. The dependent variable was the latency of the P1 cortical auditory evoked potential.RESULTS: A comparison of P1 latencies in implanted children with those of age-matched normal-hearing peers revealed that implanted children with the longest period of auditory deprivation before implantation-7 or more yr-had abnormal cortical response latencies to speech. Implanted children with the shortest period of auditory deprivation-approximately 3.5 yr or less-evidenced age-appropriate latency responses within 6 mo after the onset of electrical stimulation.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that in the absence of normal stimulation there is a sensitive period of about 3.5 yr during which the human central auditory system remains maximally plastic. Plasticity remains in some, but not all children until approximately age 7. After age 7, plasticity is greatly reduced. These data may be relevant to the issue of when best to place a cochlear implant in a congenitally deaf child."+char(34)+"",

		"Language development in profoundly deaf children with cochlear implants",
		"Although cochlear implants improve the ability of profoundly deaf children to understand speech, critics claim that the published literature does not document even a single case of a child who has dec eloped a linguistic system based on input from an implant. Thus, it is of clinical and scientific importance to determine whether cochlear implants facilitate the development of English language skills. The English language skills of prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants were measured before and after implantation. We found that the rate of language development after implantation exceeded that expected from unimplanted deaf children (p < .001) and was similar to that of children with normal hearing. Despite a large amount of individual variability, the best performers in the implanted group seem to be developing an oral linguistic system based largely on auditory input obtained from a cochlear implant."+char(34)+"",

		"A new classification for cochleovestibular malformations",
		"Objective: The report proposes a new classification system for inner ear malformations, based on radiological features of inner ear malformations reviewed in 23 patients. Study Design: The investigation took the form of a retrospective review of computerized tomography findings relating to the temporal bone in 23 patients (13 male and 10 female patients) with inner ear malformations. The subjects were patients with profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss who had all had highresolution computed tomography (CT) with contiguous 1-mm-thick images obtained through the petrous bone in axial sections. Methods: The CT results were reviewed for malformations of bony otic capsule under the following subgroups: cochlear, vestibular, semicircular canal, internal auditory canal (IAC), and vestibular and cochlear aqueduct malformations. Cochlear malformations were classified as Michel deformity, common cavity deformity, cochlear aplasia, hypoplastic cochlea, incomplete partition types I (IP-I) and II (IP-II) (Mondini deformity). Incomplete partition type I (cystic cochleovestibular malformation) is defined as a malformation in which the cochlea lacks the entire modiolus and cribriform area, resulting in a cystic appearance, and there is an accompanying large cystic vestibule. In IP-II (the Mondini deformity), there is a cochlea consisting of 1.5 turns (in which the middle and apical turns coalesce to form a cystic apex) accompanied by a dilated vestibule and enlarged vestibular aqueduct. Results: Four patients demonstrated anomalies involving only one inner ear component. All the remaining patients had diseases or conditions affecting more than one inner ear component. Eight ears had IP-I, and 10 patients had IP-II. Ears with IP-I had large cystic vestibules, whereas the amount of dilation was minimal in patients with IP-II. The majority of the semicircular canals (67%) were normal. Semicircular canal aplasia accompanied cases of Michel deformity, cochlear hypoplasia, and common cavity. In 14 ears, the IAC had a defective fundus at the lateral end. In two ears the IAC was absent. In all seven cases of common cavity malformations, there was a bony defect at the lateral end of the IAC. In five of them the IAC was enlarged, whereas in two the IAC was narrow.

		"Factors Affecting Open-Set Word Recognition in Adults With Cochlear Implants",
		"Objective: A great deal of variability exists in the speech-recognition abilities of postlingually deaf adult cochlear implant (CI) recipients. A number of previous studies have shown that duration of deafness is a primary factor affecting CI outcomes; however, there is little agreement regarding other factors that may affect performance. The objective of the present study was to determine the source of variability in CI outcomes by examining three main factors, biographic/audiologic information, electrode position within the cochlea, and cognitive abilities in a group of newly implanted CI recipients.Design: Participants were 114 postlingually deaf adults with either the Cochlear or Advanced Bionics CI systems. Biographic/audiologic information, aided sentence-recognition scores, a high resolution temporal bone CT scan and cognitive measures were obtained before implantation. Monosyllabic word recognition scores were obtained during numerous test intervals from 2 weeks to 2 years after initial activation of the CI. Electrode position within the cochlea was determined by three-dimensional reconstruction of pre- and postimplant CT scans. Participants' word scores over 2 years were fit with a logistic curve to predict word score as a function of time and to highlight 4-word recognition metrics (CNC initial score, CNC final score, rise time to 90% of CNC final score, and CNC difference score).Results: Participants were divided into six outcome groups based on the percentile ranking of their CNC final score, that is, participants in the bottom 10% were in group 1; those in the top 10% were in group 6. Across outcome groups, significant relationships from low to high performance were identified. Biographic/audiologic factors of age at implantation, duration of hearing loss, duration of hearing aid use, and duration of severe-to-profound hearing loss were significantly and inversely related to performance as were frequency modulated tone, soundfield threshold levels obtained with the CI. That is, the higher-performing outcome groups were younger in age at the time of implantation, had shorter duration of severe-to-profound hearing loss, and had lower CI sound-field threshold levels. Significant inverse relationships across outcome groups were also observed for electrode position, specifically the percentage of electrodes in scala vestibuli as opposed to scala tympani and depth of insertion of the electrode array. In addition, positioning of electrode arrays closer to the modiolar wall was positively correlated with outcome. Cognitive ability was significantly and positively related to outcome; however, age at implantation and cognition were highly correlated. After controlling for age, cognition was no longer a factor affecting outcomes.Conclusion: There are a number of factors that limit CI outcomes. They can act singularly or collectively to restrict an individual's performance and to varying degrees. The highest performing CI recipients are those with the least number of limiting factors. Knowledge of when and how these factors affect performance can favorably influence counseling, device fitting, and rehabilitation for individual patients and can contribute to improved device design and application.

		"Objectives/Hypothesis. This study documents the importance of preserving residual low-frequency acoustic hearing as those with more residual hearing are selected for cochlear implantation. Surgical strategies used for hearing preservation with a short hybrid cochlear implant are outlined. The benefits of preserved residual low-frequency hearing, improved word understanding in noise, and music appreciation are described. Study Design: Multicenter, prospective, single-subject design. Methods. Records were reviewed of 21 individuals participating in an Food and Drug Administration (FDA) feasibility clinical trial who have received an Iowa/Nucleus 10 mm electrode. A second group of subjects receiving implants at the University of Iowa that have used the 10 mm device between 2 years and 6 months were also reviewed. Outcome measures included standardized tests of monosyllabic word understanding, spondees in noise, and common melody recognition. Results. Low-frequency hearing was maintained in all individuals immediately postoperative. One subject lost hearing at 2.5 months postoperative after a viral infection. The group has averaged a loss of -9 dB low-frequency acoustic hearing between 125 and 1,000 Hz. Monosyllabic word understanding scores at 6 months for a group being followed for an FDA clinical trial using the implant plus hearing aids was 69% correct. For the long-term group receiving implants at Iowa, monosyllabic word understanding in those who have used the device between 6 months and 2 years is 79%. Other important findings include improved recognition of speech in noise (9 dB improvement) as compared with standard cochlear implant recipients who were matched for speech recognition in quiet and near normal recognition of common melodies. Conclusion. The surgical strategies outlined have been successful in preservation of low-frequency hearing in 96% of individuals. Combined electrical and acoustical speech processing has enabled this group of volunteers to gain improved word understanding as compared with their preoperative hearing with bilateral hearing aids and a group of individuals receiving a standard cochlear implant with similar experience with their device. The improvement of speech in noise and melody recognition is attributed to the ability to distinguish fine pitch differences as the result of preserved residual low-frequency acoustic hearing. Preservation of low-frequency acoustic hearing is important for improving speech in noise and music appreciation for the hearing impaired, both of which are important in real-life situations."+char(34)+"",

		"Like any other surgery requiring anesthesia, cochlear implantation in the first few years of life carries potential risks, which makes it important to assess the potential benefits. This study introduces a new method to assess the effect of age at implantation on cochlear implant outcomes: developmental trajectory analysis (DTA). DTA compares curves representing change in an outcome measure over time (i.e. developmental trajectories) for two groups of children that differ along a potentially important independent variable (e.g. age at intervention). This method was used to compare language development and speech perception outcomes in children who received cochlear implants in the second, third or fourth year of life. Within this range of age at implantation, it was found that implantation before the age of 2 resulted in speech perception and language advantages that were significant both from a statistical and a practical point of view. Additionally, the present results are consistent with the existence of a 'sensitive period' for language development, a gradual decline in language acquisition skills as a function of age.

		"Language skills of children with early cochlear implantation",
		"Objective: This study investigated factors contributing to the comprehension and production of English language by children with prelingual deafness after 4 to 7 yr of multichannel cochlear implant use. The analysis controlled for the effects of child and family characteristics so that educational factors most conducive to maximum implant benefit could be identified.Design: A battery of language tests were administered to 181 8- and 9-yr-old children from across the United States and Canada who received a cochlear implant by age 5. Tests of comprehension, verbal reasoning, narrative ability and spontaneous language production were administered either in speech and sign or in the child's preferred communication mode. These constituted the Total Language measures. Spoken Language measures were derived from a speech-only language sample. Type and amount of educational intervention since implantation constituted the independent variables. Characteristics of the child and the family were considered intervening variables. A series of multiple regression analyses determined the amount of variance in Total Language and Spoken Language ability accounted for by the intervening variables and the amount of additional variance attributable to the independent variables.Results: More than half of the children (with performance intelligence quotients in the average range) exhibited language skills that were similar to those of hearing 8 to 9 yr olds on measures of verbal reasoning, narrative ability, utterance length, and lexical diversity. Significant predictors of language ability were similar for Total and for Spoken Language outcomes and included greater nonverbal intelligence, smaller family size, higher socio-economic status and female gender. Age at receiving an implant did not affect language outcome. After the variance due to these variables was controlled, the primary rehabilitative factors associated with linguistic outcome were amount of mainstream class placement and an educational emphasis on speech and auditory skills.Conclusions: Use of a cochlear implant has had a dramatic impact on the linguistic competence of profoundly hearing-impaired children. More than half of the children in this sample with average learning ability produced and understood English language at a level comparable with that of their hearing age mates. Such mature language outcomes were not typical of children with profound hearing loss who used hearing aids. Use of a visual (i.e., sign) language system did not provide the linguistic advantage that had been anticipated. Children educated without use of sign exhibited a significant advantage in their use of narratives, the breadth of their vocabulary, in their use of bound morphemes, in the length of their utterances and in the complexity of the syntax used in their spontaneous language. An oral educational focus provided a significant advantage for both spoken and total language skills."+char(34)+"",

		"Five bilateral cochlear implant users were tested for their localization abilities and speech understanding in noise, for both monaural and binaural listening conditions. They also participated in lateralization tasks to assess the impact of variations in interaural time delays (ITDs) and interaural level differences (ILDs) for, electrical pulse trains under direct computer control. The localization task used pink noise bursts presented from an, eight-loudspeaker array spanning an arc of approximately 108degrees in front of the listeners at ear level (0-degree elevation). Subjects showed large benefits from bilateral device use compared to either side alone. Typical root-mean-square (rms) averaged errors across all eight loudspeakers in the array were about 10degrees for bilateral device use and ranged from 20degrees to 60degrees using either ear alone. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured for sentences presented from directly in front of the listeners (0degrees) in spectrally matching speech-weighted noise at either 0degrees, +90degrees or -90degrees for four subjects out of five tested who could perform the task. For noise to either side, bilateral device use showed a substantial benefit over unilateral device use when noise was ipsilateral to the unilateral device. This was primarily because of monaural head-shadow effects, which resulted in robust SRT improvements (P < 0.001) of about 4 to 5 dB when ipsilateral and contralateral noise positions were compared. The additional benefit of using both ears compared to the shadowed ear (i.e., binaural unmasking) was only 1 or 2 dB and less robust (P = 0.04). Results from the lateralization studies showed consistently good sensitivity to ILDs; better than the smallest level adjustment available in the implants (0.17 dB) for some subjects. Sensitivity to ITDs was moderate on the other hand, typically of the order of 100 mu s. ITD sensitivity deteriorated rapidly when stimulation rates for unmodulated pulse-trains increased above a few hundred Hz but at 800 pps showed sensitivity comparable to 50-pps pulse-trains when a 50-Hz modulation was applied. In our opinion, these results clearly demonstrate important benefits are available from bilateral implantation, both for localizing sounds (in quiet) and for listening in noise when signal and noise sources are spatially separated. The data do indicate, however, that effects of interaural timing cues are weaker than those from interaural level cues and according to our psychophysical findings rely on the availability of low-rate information below a few hundred Hz.

		"Music perception with cochlear implants: a review.",
		"The acceptance of cochlear implantation as an effective and safe treatment for deafness has increased steadily over the past quarter century. The earliest devices were the first implanted prostheses found to be successful in compensating partially for lost sensory function by direct electrical stimulation of nerves. Initially, the main intention was to provide limited auditory sensations to people with profound or total sensorineural hearing impairment in both ears. Although the first cochlear implants aimed to provide patients with little more than awareness of environmental sounds and some cues to assist visual speech-reading, the technology has advanced rapidly. Currently, most people with modern cochlear implant systems can understand speech using the device alone, at least in favorable listening conditions. In recent years, an increasing research effort has been directed towards implant users' perception of nonspeech sounds, especially music. This paper reviews that research, discusses the published experimental results in terms of both psychophysical observations and device function, and concludes with some practical suggestions about how perception of music might be enhanced for implant recipients in the future. The most significant findings of past research are: (1) On average, implant users perceive rhythm about as well as listeners with normal hearing; (2) Even with technically sophisticated multiple-channel sound processors, recognition of melodies, especially without rhythmic or verbal cues, is poor, with performance at little better than chance levels for many implant users; (3) Perception of timbre, which is usually evaluated by experimental procedures that require subjects to identify musical instrument sounds, is generally unsatisfactory; (4) Implant users tend to rate the quality of musical sounds as less pleasant than listeners with normal hearing; (5) Auditory training programs that have been devised specifically to provide implant users with structured musical listening experience may improve the subjective acceptability of music that is heard through a prosthesis; (6) Pitch perception might be improved by designing innovative sound processors that use both temporal and spatial patterns of electric stimulation more effectively and precisely to overcome the inherent limitations of signal coding in existing implant systems; (7) For the growing population of implant recipients who have usable acoustic hearing, at least for lowfrequency sounds, perception of music is likely to be much better with combined acoustic and electric stimulation than is typical for deaf people who rely solely on the hearing provided by their prostheses."+char(34)+"",

The 35delG mutation was identified in 29 of the 41 mutant alleles. Of probands' sibs, all homozygotes and compound heterozygotes had deafness. Fourteen of 560 controls were 35delG heterozygotes, for a carrier rate expressed as a mean (SE) of 2.5% (0.66%). The carrier rate for all recessive deafnesscausing GJB2 mutations was determined to be 3.01% (probable range, 2.54%-3.56%). Calculated sensitivity and specificity for a screening test based on 35delG mutation alone were 96.9% and 97.4%, respectively, and observed values were 94% and 97%, respectively.Conclusions Our data suggest that mutations in GJB2 are the leading cause of moderate-to-profound congenital inherited deafness in the midwestern United States. Screening of the GJB2 mutation can be offered to individuals with congenital deafness with high sensitivity and specificity by screening only for the 35delG mutation,A positive finding should establish an etiologic diagnosis and affect genetic counseling."+char(34)+"",

Speech recognition was measured as a function of target-tomasker ratio, processing condition (4, 8, 24 channels, and unprocessed) and masker type (speechshaped noise, amplitude-modulated speech-shaped noise, single male talker, and single female talker). The results showed that simulated implant processing was more detrimental to speech reception in fluctuating interference than in steady-state noise. Performance in the 24-channel processing condition was substantially poorer than in the unprocessed condition, despite the comparable representation of the spectral envelope. The detrimental effects of simulated implant processing in fluctuating maskers, even with large numbers of channels, may be due to the reduction in the pitch cues used in sound source segregation, which are normally carried by the peripherally resolved low-frequency harmonics and the temporal fine structure. The results suggest that using steady-state noise to test speech intelligibility may underestimate the difficulties experienced by cochlear-implant users in fluctuating acoustic backgrounds.

		"Role of Electrode Placement as a Contributor to Variability in Cochlear Implant Outcomes",
		"Hypothesis: Suboptimal cochlear implant (CI) electrode array placement may reduce presentation of coded information to the central nervous system and, consequently, limit speech recognition.Background: Generally, mean speech reception scores for Cl recipients are similar across different CI systems, yet large outcome variation is observed among recipients implanted with the same device. These observations suggest significant recipient-dependent factors influence speech reception performance. This study examines electrode array insertion depth and scalar placement as recipient-dependent factors affecting outcome.Methods: Scalar location and depth of insertion of intracochlear electrodes were measured in 14 patients implanted with Advanced Bionics electrode arrays and whose word recognition scores varied broadly. Electrode position was measured using computed tomographic images of the cochlea and correlated with stable monosyllabic word recognition scores.Results: Electrode placement, primarily in terms of depth of insertion and scala tympani versus scala vestibuli location, varies widely across subjects. Lower outcome scores are associated with greater insertion depth and greater number of contacts being located in scala vestibuli. Three patterns of scalar placement are observed suggesting variability in insertion dynamics arising from surgical technique. Conclusion: A significant portion of variability in word recognition scores across a broad range of performance levels of Cl subjects is explained by variability in scalar location and insertion depth of the electrode array. We suggest that this variability in electrode placement can be reduced and average speech reception improved by better selection of cochleostomy sites, revised insertion approaches, and control of insertion depth during surgical placement of the array."+char(34)+"",

		"Cortical development is dependent on stimulus-driven learning. The absence of sensory input from birth, as occurs in congenital deafness, affects normal growth and connectivity needed to form a functional sensory system, resulting in deficits in oral language learning. Cochlear implants bypass cochlear damage by directly stimulating the auditory nerve and brain, making it possible to avoid many of the deleterious effects of sensory deprivation. Congenitally deaf animals and children who receive implants provide a platform to examine the characteristics of cortical plasticity in the auditory system. In this review, we discuss the existence of time limits for, and mechanistic constraints on, sensitive periods for cochlear implantation and describe the effects of multimodal and cognitive reorganization that result from long-term auditory deprivation."+char(34)+"",

		"Eighty-seven primary-school children with impaired hearing were evaluated using speech perception, production, and language measures over a 3-year period. Forty-seven children with a mean unaided pyre-tone-overage hearing loss of 106 dB HL used a 22-electrode cochlear implant, and 40 with a mean unaided puretone-average hearing loss of 78 dB HL were fitted with hearing aids. All children were enrolled in oral/aural habilitation programs, and most attended integrated classes with normally hearing children for part of the time at school. Multiple linear regression was used to describe the relationships among the speech perception, production, and language measures, and the trends over time. little difference in the level of performance and trends was found for the two groups of children, so the perceptual effect of the implant is equivalent, on average, to an improvement of about 28 dB in hearing thresholds. Scores on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) and the Clinical Evaluation of language Fundamentals showed an upward trend at about 60% of the rate for normally hearing children. Rates of improvement for individual children were not correlated significantly with degree of hearing loss. The children showed a wide scatter about the average speech production score of 40% of words correctly produced in spontaneous conversations, with no significant upward trend with age. Scores on the open-set Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant (CNC) monosyllabic word test and the Bench-Kowal-Bamford (BKB) sentence test were strongly related to language level (as measured by an equivalent age on the PPVT) and speech production scores for both auditory-visual and auditory test conditions. After allowing for differences in language, speech perception scores in the auditory test condition showed a slight downward trend over rime, which is consistent with the known biological effects of hearing loss on the auditory periphery and brainstem. Speech perception scores in the auditory condition also decreased significantly by about 5% for every 10 de of bearing loss in the hearing aid group The regression analysis model allows separation of the effects of language, speech production, and hearing levels on speech perception scores so predicted. The model suggests that most of the children in the study will reach a level of over 90% sentence recognition in the auditory-visual condition when their language becomes equivalent to that of a normally hearing 7-year-old, but they will enter secondary school at age 12 with an average language delay of about 4 or 5 years unless they receive concentrated and effective language training."+char(34)+"",

Hierarchical linear modeling was used to identify characteristics associated with spoken language outcomes at the 2 test ages. The Preschool Language Scale (I. L. Zimmerman, V. G. Steiner, & R. E. Pond, 1992) was used to compare the participants' skills with those of hearing age-mates at age 4.5 years.Results: Expected language scores increased with younger age at implant and lower pre-implant thresholds, even when compared at the same duration of implant use. Expected Preschool Language Scale scores of the children who received the implant at the youngest ages reached those of hearing age-mates by 4.5 years, but those children implanted after 24 months of age did not catch up with hearing peers.Conclusion: Children who received a cochlear implant before a substantial delay in spoken language developed (i.e., between 12 and 16 months) were more likely to achieve age-appropriate spoken language: These results favor cochlear implantation before 24 months of age, especially for children with aided pure-tone average thresholds greater than 65 dB prior to surgery."+char(34)+"",

Learning was enhanced if listeners heard distorted sentences while they knew the identity of the undistorted target (Experiments 2 and 3). Learning was absent when listeners were trained with nonword sentences (Experiments 4 and 5), although the meaning of the training sentences did not affect learning (Experiment 5).

Speech stimuli were analyzed into 20 frequency bands and processed according to the usual SPEAK processing strategy. In the normal clinical processor each electrode is assigned to represent the output of one Filter. To create reduced-electrode processors the output of several adjacent filters were directed to a single electrode, resulting in processors with 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, and 20 electrodes. The overall spectral bandwidth was preserved, but the number of active electrodes was progressively reduced. After a 2-day period of adjustment to each processor, speech recognition performance was measured on medial consonants, vowels, monosyllabic words, and sentences. Performance with a single electrode processor was poor in all listeners, and average performance increased dramatically on all test materials as the number of electrodes was increased from 1 to 4. No differences in average performance were observed on any test in the 7-, 10-, and 20-electrode conditions. On sentence and consonant tests there was no difference between average performance with the 4-electrode and 20-electrode processors.

		"The age at which young deaf children receive cochlear implants and their vocabulary and speechproduction growth: Is there an added value for early implantation?",
		"Objective: The age at which a child receives a cochlear implant seems to be one of the more important predictors of his or her speech and language outcomes. However, understanding the association between age at implantation and child outcomes is complex because a child's age, length of device use, and age at implantation are highly related. In this study, we investigate whether there is an added value to earlier implantation or whether advantages observed in child outcomes are primarily attributable to longer device use at any given age.Design: Using hierarchical linear modeling, we examined latent-growth curves for 100 children who had received their implants when they were between 1 and 10 yr of age, had used oral communication, and had used their devices for between I and 12 yr. Children were divided into four groups based on age at implantation: between 1 and 2.5 yr, between 2.6 and 3.5 yr, between 3.6 and 7 yr, and between 7.1 and 10 yr.Results: Investigation of growth curves and rates of growth over time revealed an additional value for earlier implantation over and above advantages attributable to longer length of use at any given age. Children who had received their implants before the age of 2.5 yr had exhibited early bursts of growth in consonant-production accuracy and vocabulary and also had significantly stronger outcomes compared with age peers who had received their implants at later ages. The magnitude of the early burst diminished systematically with increasing age at implantation and was not observed for children who were older than 7 yr at implantation for consonant-production accuracy or for children who were over 3.5 yr old at implantation for vocabulary. The impact of age at implantation on children's growth curves differed for speech production and vocabulary.Conclusions: There seems to be a substantial benefit for both speech and vocabulary outcomes when children receive their implant before the age of 2.5 yr. This benefit may combine a burst of growth after implantation with the impact of increased length of use at any given age. The added advantage (i.e., burst of growth) diminishes systematically with increasing age at implantation."+char(34)+"",

		"Combining acoustic and electrical hearing",
		"Objectives/Hypothesis. The concept of combining electrical stimulation for high-frequency sound with acoustic hearing for low-frequency information was tested. In addition, whether residual hearing can be preserved when an electrode is placed into the inner ear up to 10 mm and whether place of electrical stimulation influences speech perception were tested. Study Design: A singlesubject clinical trial design was employed. Methods. Six postlingual adults with severe highfrequency hearing impairment were recruited to participate in the study. A new six-channel cochlear implant was designed for the clinical trial. The intracochlear electrodes were either 6 or 10 mm in length based on a Nucleus CI-24 multichannel implant. Monosyllabic word understanding and consonant identification testing in a recorded sound-only condition were used to assess changes in speech perception. Follow-up was greater than 12 months. Results. Acoustic hearing was preserved in all six subjects (n = 3,6-mm electrodes; n = 3, 10-mm electrodes). Preoperative monosyllabic word and sentence scores were unchanged in all subjects following implantation. A 30% to 40% improvement in consonant recognition occurred with the 10-mm electrode. The subjects with 10-mm electrodes were able to understand 83% to 90% of the monosyllabic words using the implant plus binaural hearing aids. Scores were more than doubled when compared with preoperative scores with hearing aids only. Conclusion: The human ear has the capability to integrate both acoustic and highfrequency electrically processed speech information. Placement of a short, 10-mm electrode does not appear to damage residual low-frequency inner ear hair cell function, interfere with the micro mechanics of normal cochlear vibration, or decrease residual speech perception. The improvement in speech recognition was due primarily to the increased perception of higher-frequency consonantal speech cues, and this improvement took several months to become apparent. Such a device can provide a substantial benefit in speech understanding to individuals with severe high-frequency hearing loss, while still maintaining the benefits of the residual lower-frequency acoustic hearing. The position of the electrode and the place of frequency information within the cochlea were shown to be important factors in the success of such a device."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: This study aimed to investigate 1) how a hearing aid needs to be adjusted for an adult who uses a cochlear implant in the contralateral ear; 2) whether the use of a hearing aid with a cochlear implant leads to interference; and 3) whether adults derive binaural benefits from using a hearing aid with a cochlear implant for speech perception, localization, and functional performance in everyday life.Design: Twenty-one adults (11 female and 10 male) who used either a Nucleus CI-22 (N = 3) or a Nucleus CI-24 (N = 18) cochlear implant system in one ear participated in this study. Twelve of the adults were experienced hearing aid and implant users, whereas nine did not use a hearing aid after implantation. The hearing aids were fitted using the NAL-NL1 prescription, and fine-tuned for each individual by using a paired-comparisons test to identify the frequency response that was best for understanding speech, and a loudness balancing test to find the hearing aid gain that gave the same overall loudness as that perceived in the ear with a cochlear implant. Effects from using a hearing aid with a cochlear implant (bimodal hearing) were assessed by three measures. These included speech perception in noise in diotic and dichotic listening conditions, horizontal localization, and functional performance in everyday life. Performance with cochlear implant and hearing aid (CIHA) was compared with that with cochlear implant alone (CI) and hearing aid alone (HA).Results: The NALNL1 prescribed appropriate frequency response slope on average, and the mean gain needed for binaural loudness balance was 4 dB lower than the prescribed gain. Individual variations in preferences suggest that it is desirable to fine-tune the hearing aid response slope and gain according to individual needs. The speech test results indicated that the CIHA scores were significantly better than the CI or the HA scores. Localization test results showed that the adults made significantly less error when locating a sound source using CIHA compared with CI or HA. Functional performance questionnaire scores for CIHA were significantly higher than CI scores or HA scores. All adults showed binaural benefits in at least one performance measure. On average, those who derived greater speech benefits also made less localization error and functioned more effectively in real life.Conclusions: The results clearly indicate that binaural advantages can be obtained from using a hearing aid with a cochlear implant in opposite ears. It is recommended that bimodal stimulation be standard practice for rehabilitation of adults who wear unilateral cochlear implants. A hearing aid should be fitted to the nonimplanted ear using the NAL-NL1 prescription as a starting point, and the frequency response slope and gain could be fine-tuned to suit individual needs."+char(34)+"",

		"Cochlear implant speech recognition with speech maskers",
		"Speech recognition performance was measured in normal-hearing and cochlear-implant listeners with maskers consisting of either steady-state speech-spectrum-shaped noise or a competing sentence. Target sentences from a male talker were presented in the presence of one of three competing talkers (same male, different male, or female) or speech-spectrum-shaped noise generated from this talker at several target-to-masker ratios. For the normal-hearing listeners, target-masker combinations were processed through a noise-excited vocoder designed to simulate a cochlear implant. With unprocessed stimuli, a normal-hearing control group maintained high levels of intelligibility down to target-to-masker ratios as low as 0 dB and showed a release from masking, producing better performance with single-talker maskers than with steady-state noise. In contrast, no masking release was observed in either implant or normal-hearing subjects listening through an implant simulation. The performance of the simulation and implant groups did not improve when the single-talker masker was a different talker compared to the same talker as the target speech, as was found in the normal-hearing control. These results are interpreted as evidence for a significant role of informational masking and modulation interference in cochlear implant speech recognition with fluctuating maskers. This informational masking may originate from increased target-masker similarity when spectral resolution is reduced. (C) 2004 Acoustical Society of America."+char(34)+"",

		"Current multichannel cochlear implant devices provide high levels of speech performance in quiet. However, performance deteriorates rapidly with increasing levels of background noise. The goal of this study was to investigate whether the noise susceptibility of cochlear implant users is primarily due to the loss of fine spectral information. Recognition of vowels and consonants was measured as a function of signal-to-noise ratio in four normal-hearing listeners in conditions simulating cochlear implants with both CIS and SPEAK-like strategies. Six conditions were evaluated: 3-, 4-, 8-, and 16- band processors (CIS-Like), a 6/20 band processor (SPEAK-like), and unprocessed speech. Recognition scores for vowels and consonants decreased as the S/N level worsened in all conditions, as expected. Phoneme recognition threshold (PRT) was defined as the S/N at which the recognition score fell to 50% of its level in quiet. The unprocessed speech had the best PRT, which worsened as the number of bands decreased. Recognition of vowels and consonants was further measured in three Nucleus-22 cochlear implant users using either their normal SPEAK speech processor or a. custom processor with a four-channel CIS strategy. The best cochlear implant user showed similar performance with the CIS strategy in quiet and in noise to that of normal-hearing listeners when listening to correspondingly spectrally degraded speech. These findings suggest that the noise susceptibility of cochlear implant users is at least partly due to the loss of spectral resolution. Efforts to improve the effective number of spectral information channels should improve implant performance in noise. (C) 1998 Acoustical Society of America. [S0001-4966(98)05612-4]."+char(34)+"",

		"Patterns of neural degeneration in the human cochlea and auditory nerve: Implications for cochlear implantation",
		"Although the identity of all the variables that may influence speech recognition after cochlear implantation is unknown, the degree of preservation of spiral ganglion cells is generally considered to be of primary importance. A series of experiments in our laboratories, directed at quantification of surviving spiral ganglion cells in the profoundly deaf, evaluation of the predictive value of a variety of clinical parameters, and the evaluation of the consequences of implantation in the inner ear, is summarized. Histologic study of the inner ears of patients who were deafened during life demonstrated that the cause of deafness accounted for 57% of the variability of spiral ganglion cell counts. Spiral ganglion cell counts were highest in individuals deafened by aminoglycoside toxicity or sudden idiopathic; deafness and lowest in those deafened by postnatal viral labyrinthitis, congenital or genetic deafness, or bacterial meningitis. Study of the determinants of degeneration of the spiral ganglion revealed that degeneration is most severe in the basal compared with the apical turn and more severe when both inner and outer hair cells are absent. Unlike the findings in some experimental animal studies, no survival advantage of type II ganglion cells could be identified there was a strong negative correlation between the degree of bony occlusion of the cochlea and the normality of the spiral ganglion cell count. However, even in specimens in which there was severe bony occlusion, significant numbers of spiral ganglion cells survived. A strong positive correlation between the diameter of the cochlear, vestibular, and eighth cranial nerves with the fetal spiral ganglion cell count (p < 0.001) was found. This would suggest that modern imaging techniques may be used to predict residual spiral ganglion cell population in cochlear implant candidates. Trauma from implantation of the electrode array was studied in both cadaveric human temporal bone models and temporal bones from individuals who received implants during life. A characteristic pattern of damage to the lateral cochlear wall and basilar membrane was identified in the upper basal turn. New bone formation and perielectrode fibrosis was common after cochlear implantation.

Although there has been more than a century of research on hearing by bone conduction, its physiology is not completely understood. Lately, new insights into the physiology of hearing by bone conduction have been reported. Knowledge of the physiology, clinical aspects, and limitations of bone conduction sound is important for clinicians dealing with hearing loss and is the purpose of this review.Data Sources: The data were compiled from the published literature in the areas of clinical bone conduction hearing, bone conduction hearing aids, basic research on bone conduction physiology, and recent research on bone conduction hearing from our laboratory.Conclusion: Five factors contributing to bone conduction hearing have been identified: 1) sound radiated into the external ear canal, 2) middle ear ossicle inertia, 3) inertia of the cochlear fluids, 4) compression of the cochlear walls, and 5) pressure transmission from the cerebrospinal fluid. Of these five, inertia of the cochlear fluid seems most important. E-one conduction sound is believed to reflect the true cochlear function; however, certain conditions such as middle ear diseases can affect bone conduction sensitivity, but less than for air conduction. The bone conduction route can also be used for hearing aids; since the bone conduction route is less efficient than the air conduction route, bone conduction hearing aids are primarily used for hearing losses where, air conduction hearing aids are contraindicated."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: This study investigated factors contributing to speech perception outcomes in children with prelingual deafness after 4 to 7 yr of multichannel cochlear implant use. The analysis controlled for the effects of child, family and implant characteristics so that educational factors most conducive to maximum implant benefit could be identified.Design: One hundred eighty-one 8- and 9-yr-old children from across the US and Canada who received a cochlear implant by age 5 were administered a battery of speech perception tests. Type and amount of educational intervention since implantation constituted the independent variables. Characteristics of the child, the family, and the implant itself constituted intervening variables. A series of multiple regression analyses determined the amount of variance in speech perception ability accounted for by the intervening variables and the amount of additional variance attributable to independent variables.Results: The children achieved an average level of about 50% open-set speech perception through listening alone and almost 80% through lipreading and listening together, but with scores for individual children ranging from 0 to 100% correct. Over half of the variance in speech perception scores was predicted by characteristics of the child, family, implant and educational program. Significant predictors of good speech perception included greater nonverbal intelligence, smaller family size, longer use of the updated SPEAK/CIS processing strategy, a fully active electrode array, greater electrical dynamic range between threshold and maximum comfort level, and greater growth of loudness with increasing stimulus intensity. After the variance due to these variables was controlled, the primary rehabilitative factor associated with good speech perception skill development was educational emphasis on oral-aural communication.Conclusions: Children with profound hearing loss achieved unprecedented levels of speech perception skill 4 to 7 yr after cochlear implantation. Use of an updated speech processor, such as SPEAK, contributed significantly to improved speech perception skills, even in children who were initially fitted with an earlier strategy, such as M-PEAK. In addition, the audiologist who programs the cochlear implant makes an important contribution to the child's successful outcome with the device. A well-fitted map, as evidenced by a wide dynamic range and optimal growth of loudness characteristics, contributed substantially to the child's ability to hear speech.

		"Perceptual consequences of disrupted auditory nerve activity",
		"Perceptual consequences of disrupted auditory nerve activity were systematically studied in 21 subjects who had been clinically diagnosed with auditory neuropathy (AN), a recently defined disorder characterized by normal outer hair cell function but disrupted auditory nerve function. Neurological and electrophysical evidence suggests that disrupted auditory nerve activity is due to desynchronized or reduced neural activity or both. Psychophysical measures showed that the disrupted neural activity has minimal effects on intensity-related perception, such as loudness discrimination, pitch discrimination at high frequencies, and sound localization using interaural level differences. In contrast, the disrupted neural activity significantly impairs timing related perception, such as pitch discrimination at low frequencies, temporal integration, gap detection, temporal modulation detection, backward and forward masking, signal detection in noise, binaural beats, and sound localization using interaural time differences. These perceptual consequences are the opposite of what is typically observed in cochlear-impaired subjects who have impaired intensity perception but relatively normal temporal processing after taking their impaired intensity perception into account. These differences in perceptual consequences between auditory neuropathy and cochlear damage suggest the use of different neural codes in auditory perception: a suboptimal spike count code for intensity processing, a synchronized spike code for temporal processing, and a duplex code for frequency processing. We also proposed two underlying physiological models based on desynchronized and reduced discharge in the auditory nerve to successfully account for the observed neurological and behavioral data. These methods and measures cannot differentiate between these two AN models, but future studies using electric stimulation of the auditory nerve via a cochlear implant might. These results not only show the unique contribution of neural synchrony to sensory perception but also provide guidance for translational research in terms of better diagnosis and management of human communication disorders."+char(34)+"",

		"Conservation of low-frequency hearing in cochlear implantation",
		"Objectives - As results with cochlear implants have continued to improve, patients with some remaining cochlear function have become eligible for cochlear implantation. Thus, preservation of acoustic hearing after implantation has gained importance. Hearing preservation can be considered a benchmark for atraumatic implantation preventing neural degeneration from loss of residual hair cells or subsequent to local trauma. In this prospective study, the possibility of preserving lowfrequency hearing in cochlear implantation using a modified surgical technique has been explored.Material and Methods - In a prospective study design, 14 subjects with considerable lowfrequency hearing of 20-60 dB in the frequency range 125-500 Hz but with unsatisfactory speech understanding with hearing aids of <35% monosyllabic word understanding were implanted with a MED-EL COMBI-40+ cochlear implant. The insertion depth was intentionally limited to 19-24 mm to prevent damage to low-frequency regions of the cochlea. Pre- and postoperative pure-tone thresholds were measured.Results - Hearing was conserved within 0-10 dB in 9/14 subjects and within 11-20 dB in 3/14; in 2/14 subjects hearing was completely lost in the implanted ear. Thus hearing could at least partially be conserved in 12/14 subjects (86%). Median threshold values decreased by 10, 15, 17.5 and 5 dB at 125, 250, 500 and 1000 Hz, respectively. Even high levels of hearing, e. g. 30 dB at 500 Hz, could be maintained after implantation in some subjects.Conclusions - This study reports successful conservation of hearing after cochlear implantation using a modified surgical technique. Even high levels of hearing could be maintained, showing that implantation of an intracochlear electrode can be performed atraumatically with preservation of functional structures."+char(34)+"",

		"Comparison of Pseudobinaural Hearing to Real Binaural Hearing Rehabilitation After Cochlear Implantation in Patients With Unilateral Deafness and Tinnitus",
		"Objective: Up to now, treatment modalities of unilateral deafness consist of no treatment, conventional contralateral routing of signal (CROS), or Bone-Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA) hearing aid. Cochlear implantation makes a new treatment modality available for patients with single-sided deafness. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of unilateral electrical stimulation with normal hearing on the contralateral side after a period of 6 months compared with the preoperative unaided situation, conventional CROS, or BAHA hearing aids.Study Design: Prospective design.Setting: Tertiary referral center; cochlear implant (CI) program.Patients: Eleven adult subjects with unilateral deafness of various causes were enrolled in the study. Only those patients were included in whom therapy with CROS hearing aid or BAHA was not successful and in whom the auditory nerve was found to be intact and the cochlea patent for cochlear implantation.Intervention: All subjects were fitted in random order with a BAHA Intenso mounted on the softband/tension clamp or with a CROS hearing aid. After test periods with both devices, the subjects received a CI.Main Outcome Measures: The Hochmair-Schulz-Moser sentence test and the Oldenburg sentence test were used to test speech comprehension in 3 presentation configurations in the unaided situation, with conventional CROS and BAHA hearing aids before cochlear implantation as well as after 6 months with head level in a frontal semicircle. Subjective improvement in daily life was evaluated using the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale, the Health Utilities Index 3 and the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids questionnaires. Tinnitus distress was measured with a tinnitus scale before and after CI implantation.Results: The results show significant improvement in localization ability as well as in speech comprehension in most presentation configurations with the CI. Especially, there is no negative effect on speech comprehension if the noise is presented to the CI ear and speech to the normal hearing ear. With the CI, the summation and squelch effects are not significant, but a significant combined head shadow effect is seen. Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing results show an overall benefit of wearing the CI compared with the other treatment options. The tinnitus scale revealed a positive effect of CI stimulation in cases of preoperative tinnitus.Conclusion: The results in these patients suggest that cochlear implantation improves hearing abilities in people with single-sided deafness and is superior to the alternative treatment options. The use of the CI does not interfere with speech understanding in the normal hearing ear. Our data suggest that the binaural integration of electric and acoustic stimulation is possible even with unilateral normal hearing."+char(34)+"",

Consequently, cochlear implants have been recommended for totally deaf ears only. The question has been raised whether or not it is possible to preserve residual hearing during intracochlear implantation through extremely careful surgical techniques. Experience has shown, that the cochleotomy of the scala tympani anterior to the round window niche, careful preservation of the fibrine endost layer and the use of Healon(R) are amongst the surgical procedures described which may assist in retaining the rest function of the inner ear.

		"Incapacitating unilateral tinnitus in single-sided deafness treated by cochlear implantation",
		"Objectives: Tinnitus is a well-known, difficult-to-treat symptom of hearing loss. Users of cochlear implants (CIs) have reported a reduction in tinnitus following implantation for bilateral severe-toprofound deafness. This study assessed the effect of electrical stimulation via a CI on tinnitus in subjects with unilateral deafness and ipsilateral tinnitus who underwent implantation in an attempt to treat tinnitus with the CI.Methods: Twenty-one subjects who complained of severe intractable tinnitus that was unresponsive to treatment received a CI. Tinnitus loudness was measured with a Visual Analog Scale; loudness percepts were recorded with the device activated and deactivated. Tinnitus distress was measured with the Tinnitus Questionnaire before and after implantation.Results: Electrical stimulation via a CI resulted in a significant reduction in tinnitus loudness (mean +/- SD; 1 year after implantation, 2.4 +/- 1.8; 2 years after implantation, 2.5 +/- 1.9; before implantation, 8.5 +/- 1.3). With the device deactivated, tinnitus loudness was still reduced to between 6.1 and 7.0 over 24 months. The Tinnitus Questionnaire revealed a significant positive effect of CI stimulation.Conclusions: Unilateral tinnitus resulting from single-sided deafness can be treated with electrical stimulation via a CI. The outcomes of this pilot study demonstrate a new method for treatment of tinnitus in select subjects, perhaps an important new indication for cochlear implantation."+char(34)+"",

		"Development and Validation of the AzBio Sentence Lists",
		"Objectives: The goal of this study was to create and validate a new set of sentence lists that could be used to evaluate the speech perception abilities of hearing-impaired listeners and cochlear implant (CI) users. Our intention was to generate a large number of sentence lists with an equivalent level of difficulty for the evaluation of performance over time and across conditions.Design: The AzBio sentence corpus includes 1000 sentences recorded from two female and two male talkers. The mean intelligibility of each sentence was estimated by processing each sentence through a five-channel CI simulation and calculating the mean percent correct score achieved by 15 normal-hearing listeners. Sentences from each talker were sorted by percent correct score, and 165 sentences were selected from each talker and were then sequentially assigned to 33 lists, each containing 20 sentences (5 sentences from each talker). List equivalency was validated by presenting all lists, in random order, to 15 CI users.Results: Using sentence scores from the CI simulation study produced 33 lists of sentences with a mean score of 85% correct. The results of the validation study with CI users revealed no significant differences in percent correct scores for 29 of the 33 sentence lists. However, individual listeners demonstrated considerable variability in performance on the 29 lists. The binomial distribution model was used to account for the inherent variability observed in the lists. This model was also used to generate 95% confidence intervals for one and two list comparisons. A retrospective analysis of 172 instances where research subjects had been tested on two lists within a single condition revealed that 94% of results were accurately contained within these confidence intervals.Conclusions: The use of a five-channel CI simulation to estimate the intelligibility of individual sentences allowed for the creation of a large number of sentence lists with an equivalent level of difficulty. The results of the validation procedure with CI users found that 29 of 33 lists allowed scores that were not statistically different. However, individual listeners demonstrated considerable variability in performance across lists. This variability was accurately described by the binomial distribution model and was used to estimate the magnitude of change required to achieve statistical significance when comparing scores from one and two lists per condition. Fifteen sentence lists have been included in the AzBio Sentence Test for use in the clinical evaluation of hearingimpaired listeners and CI users. An additional eight sentence lists have been included in the Minimum Speech Test Battery to be distributed by the CI manufacturers for the evaluation of CI candidates."+char(34)+"",

For speech understanding in noise, the largest and most robust bilateral benefit was when the subject was able to take advantage of the head shadow effect; i.e., results were significantly better for bilateral listening compared with the unilateral condition when the ear opposite to the side of the noise was added to create the bilateral condition. This bilateral benefit was seen on at least one of the two unilateral ear comparisons for nearly all (32/34) subjects. Bilateral benefit was also found for a few subjects in spatial configurations that evaluated binaural redundancy and binaural squelch effects. A subgroup of subjects who had asymmetrical unilateral implant performances were, overall, similar in performance to subjects with symmetrical hearing. The questionnaire data indicated that bilateral users perceive their own performance to be better with bilateral cochlear implants than when using a single device.Conclusions: Findings with a large patient group are in agreement with previous reports on smaller groups, showing that, overall, bilateral implantation offers the majority of patients advantages when listening in simulated adverse conditions."+char(34)+"",

		"Communication development in children who receive the cochlear implant younger than 12 months: Risks versus benefits",
		"Background. The advent of universal neonatal hearing screening in some countries and the availability of screening programs for at-risk infants in other countries has facilitated earlier referral, diagnosis, and intervention for infants with hearing loss. Improvements in device technology, two decades of pediatric clinical experience, a growing recognition of the efficacy of cochlear implants for young children, and the recent change in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's age criteria to include children as young as 12 mo has led to increasing numbers of young children receiving cochlear implants. Evidence to support provision for infants younger than 12 mo is extrapolated from physiological studies, studies of children using hearing aids, and studies of children older than 12 mo of age with implants. To date, however, there are few published research findings regarding communication development in children between 6 and 12 mo of age who receive implants. The current study hypothesized that earlier implantation would lead to increased rates of language acquisition as the children were still in the critical period for their development.Method. A retrospective review was completed for 19 infants (mean age at implantation, 0.88 yr; range, 0.61- 1.07, SD 0.15) and 87 toddlers (mean age at implantation, 1.60 yr; range, 1.13-2.00, SD 0.24) who received the multichannel implant in Melbourne, Australia. Preimplantation audiological assessments for these children included aided and unaided audiograms, auditory brain stem response, auditory steady state response (ASSR), and otoacoustic emission and indicated profound to total bilateral hearing loss in all cases. Communication assessment included completion of the Rossetti Infant-Toddler Language Scale and educational psychologists' cognitive and motor assessment. Computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and surgical records for all cases were reviewed. Postimplantation language assessments were reported in terms of the rate of growth over time on the language comprehension and language expression subscales of the Rossetti Infant- Toddler Language Scale.Results: Results demonstrated that cochlear implantation may be performed safely in very young children with excellent language outcomes. The mean rates of receptive (1.12) and expressive (1.01) language growth for children receiving implants before the age of 12 mo were significantly greater than the rates achieved by children receiving implants between 12 and 24 mo, and matched growth rates achieved by normally hearing peers. These preliminary results support the provision of cochlear implants for children younger than 12 mo, of age within experienced pediatric implantation centers."+char(34)+"",

		"Auditory training with spectrally shifted speech: Implications for cochlear implant patient auditory rehabilitation",
		"After implantation, postlingually deafened cochlear implant (CI) patients must adapt to both spectrally reduced and spectrally shifted speech, due to the limited number of electrodes and the limited length of the electrode array. This adaptation generally occurs during the first three to six months of implant use and may continue for many years. To see whether moderate speech training can accelerate this learning process, 16 naive, normal-hearing listeners were trained with spectrally shifted speech via an eight-channel acoustic simulation of Cl speech processing. Baseline vowel and consonant recognition was measured for both spectrally shifted and unshifted speech. Short daily training sessions were conducted over five consecutive days, using four different protocols. For the test-only protocol, no improvement was seen over the five-day period. Similarly, sentence training provided little benefit for vowel recognition. However, after five days of targeted phoneme training, subjects' recognition of spectrally shifted vowels significantly improved in most subjects. This improvement did not generalize to the spectrally unshifted vowel and consonant tokens, suggesting that subjects adapted to the specific spectral shift, rather than to the eight-channel processing in general. Interestingly, significant improvement was also observed for the recognition of spectrally shifted consonants. The largest improvement was observed with targeted vowel contrast training, which did not include any explicit consonant training. These results suggest that targeted phoneme training can accelerate adaptation to spectrally shifted speech. Given these results with normalhearing listeners, auditory rehabilitation tools that provide targeted phoneme training may be effective in improving the speech recognition performance of adult Cl users."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: To assess the influence of age at implantation on speech perception and speech intelligibility following pediatric cochlear implantation, Study Design: A prospective study was undertaken on a consecutive group of 126 congenital and prelingually deaf children up to 4 years after implantation, The study group was confined to prelingually deaf children less than 7 years of age at the time of implantation. All had implantation with the same multichannel cochlear implant system. No child was lost to follow-up, and there were no exclusions from the study. Methods: The Iowa Matrix Closed Set Sentence test, connected discourse tracking, categories of auditory performance, and speech intelligibility rating were used to assess the speech perception (closed and open set) and speech intelligibility of the children with implants. Regression analysis and Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to assess the correlation between the outcome measures with age at implantation, The setting was a tertiary referral pediatric cochlear implant center in the United Kingdom. Results: Age at implantation positively correlated with preimplantation assessment performance and with most of the outcome measures up to 24 months following implantation, However, at the 3- and 4-year intervals following implantation, age at implantation was found to be a strong negative predictor of all the outcomes studied (correlation coefficients ranging from -0.44 to -0.58, all statistically significant [P <.05]). Conclusions: The results of the present study provide strong evidence that prelingually deaf children should receive implants as early as possible to facilitate the later development of speech perception skills and speech intelligibility and thus maximize the health gain from the intervention. However, because of the wide variation in individual outcomes, age alone should not be used as a criterion to decide implant candidacy."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: To update a 15-year-old study of 800 postlinguistically deaf adult patients showing how duration of severe to profound hearing loss, age at cochlear implantation (CI), age at onset of severe to profound hearing loss, etiology and CI experience affected CI outcome. Study Design: Retrospective multicenter study. Methods: Data from 2251 adult patients implanted since 2003 in 15 international centers were collected and speech scores in quiet were converted to percentile ranks to remove differences between centers. Results: The negative effect of long duration of severe to profound hearing loss was less important in the new data than in 1996; the effects of age at CI and age at onset of severe to profound hearing loss were delayed until older ages; etiology had a smaller effect, and the effect of CI experience was greater with a steeper learning curve. Patients with longer durations of severe to profound hearing loss were less likely to improve with CI experience than patients with shorter duration of severe to profound hearing loss. Conclusions: The factors that were relevant in 1996 were still relevant in 2011, although their relative importance had changed. Relaxed patient selection criteria, improved clinical management of hearing loss, modifications of surgical practice, and improved devices may explain the differences. Copyright (c) 2012 S.

The majority of these were single-channel implants, whereas the majority of implants inserted today are multichannel systems. This report presents the histopathologic findings in temporal bones from 8 individuals who in life had undergone multichannel cochlear implantation, with particular attention to the type and location of trauma and to long-term changes within the cochlea. The effect of these changes on spiral ganglion cell counts and the correlation between speech comprehension and spiral ganglion cell counts were calculated. In 4 of the 8 cases, the opposite, unimplanted ear was available for comparison. In 3 of the 4 cases, there was no significant difference between the spiral ganglion cell counts on the implanted and unimplanted sides. In addition, in this series of 8 cases, there was an apparent negative correlation between residual spiral ganglion cell count and hearing performance during life as measured by single-syllable word recognition. This finding suggests that abnormalities in the central auditory pathways are at least as important as spiral ganglion cell loss in limiting the performance of implant users."+char(34)+"",

		"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate outcomes after cochlear implantation in children with anomalous cochleovestibular anatomy, a review of radiological classification, surgical implantation, and outcome of 103 children with such anomalies was performed. The hypothesis was that children with anomalous cochleovestibular anatomy would have poorer outcomes and therefore be poorer candidates as a result of their diminished ability to interpolate and use auditory information delivered through a cochlear implant.STUDY DESIGN: A series of studies was carried out to review the cochleovestibular anomalies among 298 children implanted over the decade ending in January 2002. Children were grouped based on cochleovestibular anatomy as follows: normal (n = 195), common cavity deformity (n = 8), hypoplastic cochlea (n = 16), incomplete partition (n = 42), and vestibular aqueduct enlargement (n = 37). Concomitant anomalies of the posterior labyrinth (n = 26) and internal auditory canal/cochlear canal (n = 11) were also identified. Findings at surgery, postoperative speech perception outcomes, and speech processor programmability were examined as a function of cochleovestibular anatomy.METHODS: A database containing demographics (age at implant, duration of implant use), audiological characteristics, pure-tone average, surgical findings (cerebrospinal fluid leak/perilymph leak, abnormal facial nerve anatomy), speech perception data (from two closed-set and three open-set tests), and data relating to speech processor programmability were used for analysis. Electrically evoked auditory brainstem response was measured in 94 of the children (2 cases of common cavity deformity, 7 of hypoplastic cochlea; 10 of incomplete partition; and 12 of vestibular aqueduct enlargement). Response morphological findings were assessed by visual inspection of the waveforms. Data were analyzed using analyses of variance with post hoc testing using the Bonferroni multiple-comparisons test. To further assess differences in outcomes between different categories of cochleovestibular anomalies, linear regression analyses were performed. The significance level was set at P < .05.RESULTS: The use of high-resolution imaging techniques resulted in the detection of a cochleovestibular anomaly in 35% of implanted ears. Implantation was more challenging in 24% of the children as a result of abnormal middle ear anatomy (17.5%) or cerebrospinal fluid leak/perilymph leak (6.7%). There was no significant difference in speech perception scores in children with anomalous cochleae compared with children with normal cochleovestibular anatomy. Children with narrowing of the internal auditory canal/cochlear canal performed more poorly than all other groups. Children with common cavity deformity and hypoplastic cochlea had reduced dynamic range and increased incidence of facial simulation and were judged to be more difficult to program despite the fact that no fewer electrodes were inserted. Children with common cavity deformity and hypoplastic cochlea tended to require wider pulse widths more often than children in other groups, and these requirements were associated with abnormal morphological findings on evoked auditory brainstem response testing.CONCLUSION: The authors have been continuing to assess the candidacy of each child applying for cochlear implantation individually, and the results of present study have suggested that the presence of anomalous cochleovestibular anatomy, with the exception of narrowing of the internal auditory canal/cochlear canal, should not play a significant role in candidacy assessment. Children with narrow internal auditory canal/cochlear canal should be carefully and individually considered. In children with anomalous cochleovestibular anatomy, the potentially increased difficulty in the establishment of optimal stimulation levels and the higher potential for surgical difficulty must be weighed in candidacy decisions but do not universally preclude successful implantation and a good outcome."+char(34)+"",

Recently, Pisoni and Geers (2000) reported that simple forward digit span measures of verbal working memory were significantly correlated with spoken word recognition scores even after potentially confounding variables were statistically controlled for. The present study replicates and extends these initial findings to the full set of 176 participants in the CID cochlear implant study. The pooled data indicate that despite statistical "+char(34)+"partialling-out"+char(34)+" of differences in chronological age, communication mode, duration of deafness, duration of device use, age at onset of deafness, number of active electrodes, and speech feature discrimination, significant correlations still remain between digit span and several measures of spoken word recognition. Strong correlations were also observed between speaking rate and both forward and backward digit span, a result that is similar to previously reported findings in normal-hearing adults and children. The results suggest that perhaps as much as 20% of the currently unexplained variance in spoken word recognition scores may be independently accounted for by individual differences in cognitive factors related to the speed and efficiency with which phonological and lexical representations of spoken words are maintained in and retrieved from working memory. A smaller percentage, perhaps about 7% of the currently unexplained variance in spoken word recognition scores, may be accounted for in terms of working memory capacity. We discuss how these relationships may arise and their contribution to subsequent speech and language development in prelingually deaf children who use cochlear implants."+char(34)+"",

For both OC and SG frequency maps, a potentially important limitation is that accurate estimates of cochlear place frequency based upon the Greenwood function require knowledge of the total OC or SG length, which cannot be determined in most temporal bone and imaging studies. Therefore, an additional goal of this study was to evaluate a simple metric, basal coil diameter that might be utilized to estimate OC and SG length. Cadaver cochleae (n = 9) were fixed <24 h postmortem, stained with osmium tetroxide, microdissected, decalcified briefly, embedded in epoxy resin, and examined in surface preparations. In digital images, the OC and SG were measured, and the radial nerve fiber trajectories were traced to define a series of frequency-matched coordinates along the two structures. Images of the cochlear turns were reconstructed and measurements of basal turn diameter were made and correlated with OC and SG measurements. The data obtained provide a mathematical function for relating represented frequency along the OC to that of the SG. Results showed that whereas the distance along the OC that corresponds to a critical bandwidth is assumed to be constant throughout the cochlea, estimated critical band distance in the SG varies significantly along the spiral. Additional findings suggest that measurements of basal coil diameter in preoperative images may allow prediction of OC/SG length and estimation of the insertion depth required to reach specific angles of rotation and frequencies. Results also indicate that OC and SG percentage length expressed as a function of rotation angle from the round window is fairly constant across subjects.

What characteristics predict successful spoken language development in this population? Are children with CIs more proficient in some areas of language than others? We analyzed language skills of 153 children with CIs as measured by standardized tests. These children (mean age = 5 years and 10 months) attended programs in the United States (N = 39) that used an auditory-oral educational approach. Age-appropriate scores were observed in 50% of the children on measures of receptive vocabulary, 58% on expressive vocabulary, 46% on verbal intelligence, 47% on receptive language, and 39% on expressive language. Regression analysis indicated that, after controlling for the effects of nonverbal intelligence and parent education level, children who received their implants at young ages had higher scores on all language tests than children who were older at implantation. On average, children with CIs performed better on certain language measures than others, indicating that some areas of language may be more difficult for these children to master than others. Implications for educators of deaf children with CIs are discussed."+char(34)+"",

The 73 participants were prelingually deafened, received a cochlear implant before 5 years of age, and used current cochlear implant technology. The children were administered a battery of speech and language outcome measures before implantation and again at successive 6-month postimplant intervals. A mixed model analysis was used to examine the rate of growth in word recognition and language skills as a function of age at time of implantation. The results revealed significant improvements in communication skills over time. Spoken word recognition improved at a faster rate in the oral children with early implantation. However, the children who underwent implantation before 3 years of age had significantly faster rates of language development than did the children with later implantation. The oral children demonstrated more rapid gains in communication abilities than did the children who used total communication."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between electrically evoked whole nerve action potential (EAP) and electrical auditory brain stem response (EABR) thresholds and MAP threshold (T-level) and maximum comfort level (C-level) for subjects who use the Nucleus 24 cochlear implant system.Design: Forty-four adult Nucleus 24 cochlear implant users participated in this study. EAP thresholds were recorded using the Neural Response Telemetry System developed by Cochlear Corporation. EABR thresholds were measured for a subset of 14 subjects using standard evoked potential techniques. These physiologic thresholds were collected on a set of five electrodes spaced across the cochlea, and were then compared with behavioral measures of T-level and C-level used to program the speech processor.Results: EAP thresholds were correlated with MAP T- and Clevels; however, the correlation was not strong. A technique for improving the correlation by combining measures of T- and C-levels made on one electrode with the EAP thresholds was presented. Correlations between predicted and measured T- and C-levels using this technique were 0.83 and 0.77, respectively. Similar results were obtained using the EABR thresholds for a smaller set of subjects. In general, EABR thresholds were recorded at levels that were approximately 4.7 programming units lower than EAP thresholds.Conclusions: Either EAP or EABR thresholds can be used in combination with a limited amount of behavioral information to predict MAP T- and C-levels with reasonable accuracy."+char(34)+"",

		"Conclusions. Hearing may be conserved in adults after implantation with the Nucleus Contour Advance perimodiolar electrode array. The degree of hearing preservation and the maximum insertion depth of the electrode array can vary considerably despite a defined surgical protocol. Residual hearing combined with electrical stimulation in the same ear can provide additional benefits even for conventional candidates for cochlear implantation. Objectives. We present preliminary results from a prospective multicentre study investigating the conservation of residual hearing after implantation with a standard-length Nucleus Contour Advance perimodiolar electrode array and the benefits of combined electrical and acoustic stimulation. Material and methods. The subjects were 12 adult candidates for cochlear implantation recruited according to national selection criteria. A "+char(34)+"soft'' surgery protocol was defined, as follows: 1 - 1.2- mm cochleostomy hole anterior and inferior to the round window; Nucleus Contour Advance electrode array inserted using the "+char(34)+"Advance-off-stylet'' technique; and insertion depth controlled by means of three square marker ribs left outside the cochleostomy hole. These procedures had been shown to reduce insertion forces in temporal bone preparations. Variations in surgical techniques were monitored using a questionnaire. Pure-tone thresholds were measured pre- and postoperatively. Patients who still retained thresholds < 90 dB HL for frequencies up to 500 Hz were re-fitted with an in-the-ear (ITE) hearing aid. Word recognition was tested in quiet and sentence perception in noise for the cochlear implant alone and in combination with an ipsilateral hearing aid. Results. Hearing threshold level data were available for 12 patients recruited from 6 of the centres. Median increases in hearing threshold levels were 23, 27 and 33 dB for the frequencies 125, 250 and 500 Hz, respectively. These median increases include the data for two patients who had total loss of residual hearing due to difficulties encountered during surgery. "+char(34)+"Cochlear view'' X-ray images indicated that the depth of insertion varied between 300 and 4308, despite modest variations in the length of the electrode inserted ( 17 - 19 mm). The insertion angle had some influence on the preservation of residual hearing at frequencies of 250 - 500 Hz. Six of the 12 patients retained sufficient hearing for effective use of an ipsilateral ITE hearing aid ( <= 80 dB HL at 125 and 250 Hz; <= 90 dB HL at 500 Hz). Word recognition scores in quiet were improved from 10% to 30% with the cochlear implant plus ipsilateral hearing aid in 3 patients who had at least 3 months postoperative experience.

		"Effects of early auditory experience on the spoken language of deaf children at 3 years of age",
		"Objective: By age 3, typically developing children have achieved extensive vocabulary and syntax skills that facilitate both cognitive and social development. Substantial delays in spoken language acquisition have been documented for children with severe to profound deafness, even those with auditory oral training and early hearing aid use. This study documents the spoken language skills achieved by orally educated 3-yr-olds whose profound hearing loss was identified and hearing aids fitted between 1 and 30 mo of age and who received a cochlear implant between 12 and 38 mo of age. The purpose of the analysis was to examine the effects of age, duration, and type of early auditory experience on spoken language competence at age 3.5 yr.Design: The spoken language skills of 76 children who had used a cochlear implant for at least 7 mo were evaluated via standardized 30-minute language sample analysis, a parent-completed vocabulary checklist, and a teacher language-rating scale. The children were recruited from and enrolled in oral education programs or therapy practices across the United States. Inclusion criteria included presumed deaf since birth, English the primary language of the home, no other known conditions that interfere with speech/language development, enrolled in programs using oral education methods, and no known problems with the cochlear implant lasting more than 30 days.Results: Strong correlations were obtained among all language measures. Therefore, principal components analysis was used to derive a single Language Factor score for each child. A number of possible predictors of language outcome were examined, including age at identification and intervention with a hearing aid, duration of use of a hearing aid, pre-implant pure-tone average (PTA) threshold with a hearing aid, PTA threshold with a cochlear implant, and duration of use of a cochlear implant/ age at implantation (the last two variables were practically identical because all children were tested between 40 and 44 mo of age). Examination of the independent influence of these predictors through multiple regression analysis revealed that pre-implant-aided PTA threshold and duration of cochlear implant use (i.e., age at implant) accounted for 58% of the variance in Language Factor scores. A significant negative coefficient associated with preimplant-aided threshold indicated that children with poorer hearing before implantation exhibited poorer language skills at age 3.5 yr. Likewise, a strong positive coefficient associated with duration of implant use indicated that children who had used their implant for a longer period of time (i.e., who were implanted at an earlier age) exhibited better language at age 3.5 yr. Age at identification and amplification was unrelated to language outcome, as was aided threshold with the cochlear implant. A significant quadratic trend in the relation between duration of implant use and language score revealed a steady increase in language skill (at age 3.5 yr) for each additional month of use of a cochlear implant after the first 12 mo of implant use. The advantage to language of longer implant use became more pronounced over time.Conclusions: Longer use of a cochlear implant in infancy and very early childhood dramatically affects the amount of spoken language exhibited by 3-yr-old, profoundly deaf children. In this sample, the amount of pre-implant intervention with a hearing aid was not related to language outcome at 3.5 yr of age. Rather, it was cochlear implantation at a younger age that served to promote spoken language competence. The previously identified language-facilitating factors of early identification of hearing impairment and early educational intervention may not be sufficient for optimizing spoken language of profoundly deaf children unless it leads to early cochlear implantation."+char(34)+"",

Speech tests included monosyllables in quiet and sentences in noise (10 dB signal to noise ratio). Speech was presented from the front, and noise was presented from either 90degrees or 270degrees azimuth.Results: All subjects reported benefit from bilateral stimulation. Speech scores for all subjects were higher with bilateral than with unilateral stimulation. The average score across subjects for sentence understanding was 31.1 percentage points higher with both cochlear implants compared with the cochlear implant ipsilateral to the noise, and 10.7 percentage points higher with both cochlear implants compared with the cochlear implant contralateral to the noise. The average score for recognition of monosyllabic words was 18.7 percentage points higher with both cochlear implants than with one cochlear implant. All of these differences in average scores were significant at the 5% level.Conclusions: Bilateral cochlear implantation provides a significant benefit in speech understanding in both quiet and noise."+char(34)+"",

		"Spectral peak resolution was investigated in normal hearing (NH), hearings impaired (HI), and cochlear implant (CI) listeners. The task involved discriminating between two rippled noise stimuli in which the frequency positions of the log-spaced peaks and valleys were interchanged. The ripple spacing was varied adaptively from 0.13 to 11.31 ripples/octave, and the minimum ripple spacing at which a reversal in peak and trough positions could be detected was determined as the spectral peak resolution threshold for each listener. Spectral peak resolution was best, on average, in NH listeners, poorest in Cl listeners, and intermediate for HI listeners. There was a significant relationship between spectral peak resolution and both vowel and consonant recognition in quiet across the three listener groups. The results indicate that the degree of spectral peak resolution required for accurate vowel and consonant recognition in quiet backgrounds is around 4 ripples/octave, and that spectral peak resolution poorer than around 1-2 ripples/octave may result in highly degraded speech recognition. These results suggest that efforts to improve spectral peak resolution for HI and Cl users may lead to improved speech recognition. (C) 2005 Acoustical Society of America."+char(34)+"",

		"The aim of this clinical study was to assess speech recognition in noise after cochlear implantation in subjects with single-sided deafness and incapacitating tinnitus. 20 subjects complaining of severe intractable tinnitus unresponsive to treatment received a MED-EL cochlear implant (CI). 11 subjects had normal hearing (NH group) on the contralateral side, while 9 used a hearing aid (HA group). The subjects were tested in noise in two listening conditions, i.e. with their acoustic hearing only and with adding the CI to the acoustic hearing (binaural). Subjective improvement in daily life was evaluated using the Speech Spatial and Qualities Hearing Scale (SSQ). The summation effect (3.3 dB for the HA group and 0.6 dB for the NH group) is not significant in both groups. A significant squelch effect of adding the CI was seen for the HA users (3.8 dB), but not for the NH group (1.2 dB). Additionally, a significant effect of adding the CI was found for the spatial configuration where noise is presented in front and speech on the CI side for both the HA group (6.5 dB) and the NH group (1.7 dB). Results of the SSQ show a significant overall benefit of wearing the CI for both groups.

		"Risk of bacterial meningitis in children with cochlear implants",
		"BACKGROUND:In June 2002, the Food and Drug Administration received reports of bacterial meningitis in patients with cochlear implants for treatment of hearing loss. Implants that included a positioner (a wedge inserted next to the implanted electrode to facilitate transmission of the electrical signal by pushing the electrode against the medial wall of the cochlea) were voluntarily recalled in the United States in July 2002.METHODS:We identified patients with meningitis and conducted a cohort study and a nested case-control investigation involving 4264 children who had received cochlear implants in the United States between January 1, 1997, and August 6, 2002, and who were less than six years of age when they received the implants. We calculated the incidence of meningitis in the cohort and assessed risk factors for meningitis among patients and among 199 controls, using data from interviews with parents and abstracted from medical records.RESULTS:We identified 26 children with bacterial meningitis. The incidence of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae was 138.2 cases per 100,000 person-years - more than 30 times the incidence in a cohort of the same age in the general U.S. population. Postimplantation bacterial meningitis was strongly associated with the use of an implant with a positioner (odds ratio, 4.5 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 17.9], with adjustment for medical, surgical, and environmental factors) and with the joint presence of radiographic evidence of a malformation of the inner ear and a cerebrospinal fluid leak (adjusted odds ratio, 9.3 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 94.5]). The incidence of meningitis among patients who had received an implant with a positioner remained higher than the incidence among those whose implants did not have a positioner for the duration of follow-up (24 months from the time of implantation).CONCLUSIONS:Parents and health care providers should ensure that all children who receive cochlear implants are appropriately vaccinated and are then monitored and treated promptly for any bacterial infections after receiving the implant."+char(34)+"",

		"Neurotrophic factor intervention restores auditory function in deafened animals",
		"A primary cause of deafness is damage of receptor cells in the inner ear. Clinically, it has been demonstrated that effective functionality can be provided by electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve, thus bypassing damaged receptor cells. However, subsequent to sensory cell loss there is a secondary degeneration of the afferent nerve fibers, resulting in reduced effectiveness of such cochlear prostheses. The effects of neurotrophic factors were tested in a guinea pig cochlear prosthesis model. After chemical deafening to mimic the clinical situation, the neurotrophic factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor and an analogue of ciliary neurotrophic factor were infused directly into the cochlea of the inner ear for 26 days by using an osmotic pump system. An electrode introduced into the cochlea was used to elicit auditory responses just as in patients implanted with cochlear prostheses. Intervention with brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the ciliary neurotrophic factor analogue not only increased the survival of auditory spiral ganglion neurons, but significantly enhanced the functional responsiveness of the auditory system as measured by using electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses. This demonstration that neurotrophin intervention enhances threshold sensitivity within the auditory system will have great clinical importance for the treatment of deaf patients with cochlear prostheses. The findings have direct implications for the enhancement of responsiveness in deafferented peripheral nerves."+char(34)+"",

		"Speech recognition materials and ceiling effects: Considerations for cochlear implant programs",
		"Cochlear implant recipients have demonstrated remarkable increases in speech perception since US FDA approval was granted in 1984. Improved performance is due to a number of factors including improved cochlear implant technology, evolving speech coding strategies, and individuals with increasingly more residual hearing receiving implants. Despite this evolution, the same recommendations for pre-and postimplant speech recognition testing have been in place for over 10 years in the United States. To determine whether new recommendations are warranted, speech perception performance was assessed for 156 adult, postlingually deafened implant recipients as well as 50 hearing aid users on monosyllabic word recognition (CNC) and sentence recognition in quiet (HINT and AzBio sentences) and in noise (BKB-SIN). Results demonstrated that for HINT sentences in quiet, 28% of the subjects tested achieved maximum performance of 100% correct and that scores did not agree well with monosyllables (CNC) or sentence recognition in noise (BKBSIN). For a more difficult sentence recognition material (AzBio), only 0.7% of the subjects achieved 100% performance and scores were in much better agreement with monosyllables and sentence recognition in noise. These results suggest that more difficult materials are needed to assess speech perception performance of postimplant patients - and perhaps also for determining implant candidacy.

Data also were obtained from a cohort of age and hearing eve matched children with sensorineural hearing loss.Results: The speech perception performance of the 15 children with AN able to complete a PBK-word assessment, fell into two distinct categories. The children either showed no open-set speech perception ability (7/15 cases), or performance levels similar to their sensorineural counterparts (8/15 cases). Approximately 50% of children with AN showed ERPs of normal latency, amplitude and morphology. In all cases, response presence (at normal latencies) was consistent with reasonable speech perception ability, and response absence was consistent with negligible speech perception.Conclusions: In approximately 50% of children with auditory neuropathy, the provision of amplification results in significant openset speech perception improvements. The results confirm the previously published reports that speech perception ability cannot be reliably estimated from the behavioral audiogram in children with AN. Obligatory ERP test results may offer a means of predicting perceptual skills in newly diagnosed youngsters as the presence of ERPs (with age-appropriate latency and morphology) was correlated with significant open set speech perception abilities and amplification benefit. The absence of the ERP in contrast, indicated profound hearing disability evidenced by profound hearing loss and/or extremely poor speech perception."+char(34)+"",

		"Ten newborn kittens were deafened by systemic administration of neomycin sulfate. Profound hearing losses were documented by ABR and FFR (500 Hz) testing. At 9-17 weeks of age, the young deafened cats were unilaterally implanted with a multichannel scala tympani electrode. Six of the animals were chronically stimulated at 6 dB above electrically evoked ABR thresholds for 1 h/day for periods of 1 month or 3 months. Stimuli were charge-balanced biphasic pulses (200-mu-s/phase, 30 pps.) The remaining 4 cats underwent identical deafening and implantation schedules but were not stimulated. Results indicate that administration of neomycin in neonatal cats induced degeneration of hair cells and spiral ganglion cell loss that was bilaterally symmetrical between the two cochleas of each individual animal, although there was variation between animals in the severity of the ototoxic drug effect. In animals receiving passive (unstimulated) implants, morphometric analysis of spiral ganglion cell density showed no significant difference in ganglion cell survival between the implanted cochleas and the contralateral control ears. In contrast, animals that were chronically stimulated for 3 months showed significantly better neuronal survival in implanted and stimulated cochleas as compared to contralateral deafened control ears. The induced conservation of spiral ganglion neurons was observed consistently within the basal cochlear region near the stimulating electrodes. In more apical regions there was no significant difference between the stimulated and control cochleas. The mechanisms underlying this selective conservation of spiral ganglion neurons induced by chronic intracochlear electrical stimulation are uncertain. Since no comparable chronic stimulation studies have been conducted in adults, it is not known whether similar conservation effects could be induced in mature animals."+char(34)+"",

The present study was designed to evaluate the physiological and histopathological effects of long-term intracochlear electrical stimulation using these high rates. Thirteen normal-hearing adult cats were bilaterally implanted with scala tympani electrode arrays and unilaterally stimulated for periods of up to 2100 h using either two pairs of bipolar or three monopolar stimulating electrodes. Stimuli consisted of short duration (25-50 mu s/phase) chargebalanced biphasic current pulses presented at 1000 pulses per second (pps) per channel for monopolar stimulation, and 2000 pps/channel for bipolar stimulation. The electrodes were shorted between current pulses to minimize any residual direct current, and the pulse trains were presented using a 50% duty cycle (500 ms on; 500 ms off) in order to simulate speech. Both acoustic (ABR) and electrical (EABR) auditory brainstem responses were recorded periodically during the chronic stimulation program. All cochleas showed an increase in the click-evoked ABR threshold following implant surgery; however, recovery to near-normal levels occurred in approximately half of the stimulated cochleas 1 month post-operatively. The use of frequency-specific stimuli indicated that the most extensive hearing loss generally occurred in the high-frequency basal region of the cochlea (12 and 24 kHz) adjacent to the stimulating electrode. However, thresholds at lower frequencies (2, 4 and 8 kHz), appeared at near-normal levels despite long-term electrode implantation and electrical stimulation. Our longitudinal EABR results showed a statistically significant increase in threshold in nearly 40% of the chronically stimulated electrodes evaluated; however, the gradient of the EABR input/output (I/O) function (evoked potential response amplitude versus stimulus current) generally remained quite stable throughout the chronic stimulation period. Histopathological examination of the cochleas showed no statistically significant difference in ganglion cell densities between cochleas using monopolar and bipolar electrode configurations (P = 0.67), and no evidence of cochlear damage caused by high-rate electrical stimulation when compared with control cochleas. Indeed, there was no statistically significant relationship between spiral ganglion cell density and electrical stimulation (P = 0.459), or between the extent of loss of inner (LHC, P = 0.86) or outer (OHC, P = 0.30) hair cells and electrical stimulation. Spiral ganglion cell loss was, however, influenced by the degree of inflammation (P = 0.016) and electrode insertion trauma. These histopathological findings were consistent with the physiological data. Finally, electrode impedance, measured at completion of the chronic stimulation program, showed close correlation with the degree of tissue response adjacent to the electrode array. These results indicated that chronic intracochlear electrical stimulation, using carefully controlled charge-balanced biphasic current pulses at stimulus rates of up to 2000 pps/channel, does not appear to adversely affect residual auditory nerve elements or the cochlea in general. This study provides an important basis for the safe application of improved speech-processing strategies based on high-rate electrical stimulation."+char(34)+"",

		"Degeneration of auditory neurons occurs after deafening and is associated with damage to the organ of Corti. The administration of neurotrophins can protect auditory neurons against degeneration if given shortly after deafening. However, it is not known whether the delayed administration of neurotrophins, when significant degeneration has already occurred, will provide similar protection. Furthermore, little is known about the effects of neurotrophins on the peripheral processes of the auditory neurons or whether these neurons can resprout. This study examined the morphological effects on auditory neurons following deafening and the administration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3. Results showed that neurotrophins were effective in preventing death of auditory neurons if administered 5 days after deafening and were also effective in preventing the continued loss of neurons if the administration was delayed by 33 days. The peripheral processes of auditory neurons in cochleae that received neurotrophins were in greater number and had larger diameters compared with the untreated cochleae. Localized regions of resprouting peripheral processes were observed in deafened cochleae and were enhanced in response to neurotrophin treatment, occurring across wider regions of the cochlea. These findings have significant implications for an improvement in the performance of the cochlear implant and for future therapies to restore hearing to the deaf."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: To examine whether age at cochlear implantation or duration of implant use is associated with speech, language, and reading skills exhibited at age 8 to 9 years in children who underwent implantation by age 5 years.Design: Performance outcomes in speech perception, speech production, language, and reading were examined in terms of the age at which children first received a cochlear implant (2, 3, or 4 years), the age they received an updated (Spectra) processor, and the duration of use of an implant and an updated processor.Setting: Data collection was conducted at summer research camps held over 4 consecutive years to maximize the number of children available at a specific age (8-9 years). Children were tested individually by experienced examiners, and their parents and therapists provided background and educational history information.Participants: A total of 181 children from 33 different states and 5 Canadian provinces who received a cochlear implant by age 5 years were tested. A subsample of 133 children with performance IQ scores of 80 or greater and onset of deafness at birth were selected for the age-at-implantation analysis. Another subsample of 39 children with deafness acquired by age 3 years was also examined.Outcome Measures: A battery of tests of speech perception, speech production, language, and reading was administered to each child and reduced to a single factor score for each skill.Results: Correlation coefficients between age at implantation and duration of use did not reach significance for any of the outcome skills measured. Age at which the updated speech processor (Spectra) was fitted was significantly related to speech production outcome (earlier use of an updated processor was associated with greater speech intelligibility) but not to any other skill area. However, more of the children who underwent implantation at age 2 years (43%) achieved combined speech and language skills commensurate with their age-matched peers with normal hearing than did children who underwent implantation at age 4 years (16%). Furthermore, normal speech and language skills were documented in 80% of children who lost hearing after birth and who underwent implantation within a year of onset of deafness.Conclusions: For children who receive a cochlear implant between the ages of 2 and 4 years, early cochlear implantation does not ensure better speech perception, speech production, language, or reading skills. However, greater speech and language proficiency may be expected from children who exhibit normal hearing for even a brief period after birth and receive a cochlear implant shortly after losing their hearing. Further research examining the benefits of cochlear implantation before age 2 years will help families and clinicians better understand the timesensitive nature of the decision to conduct cochlear implant surgery."+char(34)+"",

It is the most effective prosthesis in terms of restoration of function, and the people who have received a cochlear implant outnumber the recipients of other types of neural prostheses by orders of magnitude. The primary purpose of this article is to provide an overview of contemporary cochlear implants from the perspective of two designers of implant systems. That perspective includes the anatomical situation presented by the deaf cochlea and how the different parts of an implant system (including the user's brain) must work together to produce the best results. In particular, we present the design considerations just mentioned and then describe in detail how the Current levels of performance have been achieved. We also describe two recent advances in implant design and performance. In concluding sections, we first present strengths and limitations of present systems and then offer some possibilities for further improvements in this technology. In all, remarkable progress has been made in the development of cochlear implants but much room still remains for improvements, especially for patients presently at the low end of the performance spectrum."+char(34)+"",

		"Factors associated with development of speech production skills in children implanted by age five",
		"Objective. This study investigated speech production outcomes and the factors influencing the outcomes in children who had 4 to 6 yr of experience with a multichannel cochlear implant. Production variables examined included speech intelligibility, accuracy of consonant and vowel production, percentage of plosives and fricatives produced, duration of sentences, percentage of time involved in communication breakdowns during a communication sample, and responses to a speech usage questionnaire.Design: 181 children between the ages of 8 and 9 yr who received a multichannel cochlear implant before age 5 yr participated as subjects. Independent variables were the amount and type of educational intervention and intervening variables were distributed across child, family and implant characteristics. Multiple regression analyses provided a measure of the amount of variance associated with speech production skills accounted for by the intervening and independent variables.Results: Performance for the key words in the speech intelligibility measured averaged 63.5% for the group of children. Accuracy of phoneme production was higher for consonants (68.0%) than for vowels (61.6%) for the group. More plosives were present for acoustic analyses (91.6%) than were fricatives (78.4%). Duration for the speech intelligibility sentences averaged 2572.3 msec. Communication breakdowns occurred on average 14.5% of the time involved in a language sample. Significant predictors of high levels of oral communication skills included higher nonverbal intelligence, gender, longer use of SPEAK processing strategy, a fully active electrode array, greater dynamic range, and greater growth of loudness. The primary rehabilitative factors contributing to high levels of oral communication were an emphasis on oral-aural communication and classrooms that emphasized dependence on speech and listening.Conclusions: Speech production performance in children with cochlear implants is influenced by nonverbal intelligence, gender, implant characteristics including the length of time using the newest speech processing strategies, and educational programs emphasizing oral-aural communication. Factors previously thought to be major contributors to speech production performance, such as age of onset of deafness and age of implantation, did not appear to play significant roles in predicting levels of speech production performance."+char(34)+"",

		"Clinical studies of families with hearing loss attributable to mutations in the connexin 26 gene (GJB2/DFNB1)",
		"Objective. This retrospective study describes the phenotype associated with the single most common cause of genetic hearing loss. The frequency of childhood deafness is estimated at 1/500. Half of this hearing loss is genetic and similar to 80% of genetic hearing loss is nonsyndromic and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Approximately 50% of childhood nonsyndromic recessive hearing loss is caused by mutations in the connexin 26 (Cx26) gene (GJB2/DFNB1), making it the most common form of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss with a carrier rate estimated to be as high as 2.8%. One mutation, 35delG, accounts for similar to 75% to 80% of mutations at this gene.Methods. Hearing loss was examined in 46 individuals from 24 families who were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for Cx26 mutations. A subset of these individuals were examined for vestibular function, otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem response, temporal bone computed tomography, electrocardiography, urinalyses, dysmorphology, and thyroid function.Results. Although all persons had hearing impairment, no consistent audiologic phenotype was observed. Hearing loss varied from mild-moderate to profound, even within the group of families homozygous for the common mutation 35delG, suggesting that other factors modify the phenotypic effects of mutations in Cx26. Furthermore, the hearing loss was observed to be progressive in a number of cases. No associations with inner ear abnormality, thyroid dysfunction, heart conduction defect, urinalyses, dysmorphic features, or retinal abnormality were noted.Conclusion. Newborns with confirmed hearing loss should have Cx26 testing. Cx26 testing will help define a group in which similar to 60% will have profound or severe-profound hearing loss and require aggressive language intervention (many of these patients will be candidates for cochlear implants)."+char(34)+"",

Speech was always presented from the front. Noise was either presented from the front, from the left side, or from the right side. Each condition was measured for unilateral and bilateral implant use.Results: For three subjects, the test was too difficult to be administered. The 18 subjects from whom a complete data set could be obtained showed a significant head shadow effect and summation effect for all test conditions, whereas the squelch effect was significant for noise from the left side only.

		"There are now many recipients of unilateral cochlear implants who have usable residual hearing in the non-implanted ear. To avoid auditory deprivation and to provide binaural hearing, a hearing aid or a second cochlear implant can be fitted to that ear. This article addresses the question of whether better binaural hearing can be achieved with binaural/bimodal fitting (combining a cochlear implant and a hearing aid in opposite ears) or bilateral implantation. In the first part of this article, the rationale for providing binaural hearing is examined. In the second part, the literature on the relative efficacy of binaural/bimodal fitting and bilateral implantation is reviewed. Most studies on comparing either mode of bilateral stimulation with unilateral implantation reported some binaural benefits in some test conditions on average but revealed that some individuals benefited, whereas others did not. There were no controlled comparisons between binaural/bimodal fitting and bilateral implantation and no evidence to support the efficacy of one mode over the other. In the third part of the article, a crossover trial of two adults who had binaural/bimodal fitting and who subsequently received a second implant is reported. The findings at 6 and 12 months after they received their second implant indicated that binaural function developed over time, and the extent of benefit depended on which abilities were assessed for the individual.

		"The cochlear implant (CI) is a neuroprosthesis that allows profoundly deaf patients to recover speech intelligibility. This recovery goes through long-term adaptative processes to build coherent percepts from the coarse information delivered by the implant. Here we analyzed the longitudinal postimplantation evolution of word recognition in a large sample of Cl users in unisensory (visual or auditory) and bisensory (visuoauditory) conditions. We found that, despite considerable recovery of auditory performance during the first year postimplantation, Cl patients maintain a much higher level of word recognition in speechreading conditions compared with normally hearing subjects, even several years after implantation. Consequently, we show that Cl users present higher visuoauditory performance when compared with normally hearing subjects with similar auditory stimuli. This better performance is not only due to greater speechreading performance, but, most importantly, also due to a greater capacity to integrate visual input with the distorted speech signal. Our results suggest that these behavioral changes in Cl users might be mediated by a reorganization of the cortical network involved in speech recognition that favors a more specific involvement of visual areas. Furthermore, they provide crucial indications to guide the rehabilitation of Cl patients by using visually oriented therapeutic strategies."+char(34)+"",

		"Although numerous paediatric-based health-related quality-of-life (HR-QOL) instruments are currently in use, there still remain conceptual, methodological and developmental issues to address. This paper provides an up-to-date critical review of the HR-QOL literature in paediatric medicine.Our analysis indicates that there is no consensus on how HR-QOL and overall. QOL should be defined and measured in children. It is recommended that future studies focus on operationalising and distinguishing these constructs from each other and from traditional healthstatus measures. A clear empirical basis for generating instrument items and for prioritising specific domains must be described. Researchers should consider using the data gathered during their first interviews as a springboard from which to test their ideas of HR-QOL and QOL, reformulate concepts and subsequently retest their notions before developing instruments.Related to methodological challenges, consistency and agreement are still used interchangeably when comparing child and parent reports of children's HR-QOL. The Pearson correlation is a measure of co-variation in scores, and not a measure of agreement. We recommend that researchers focus on determining, agreement as opposed to consistency. Few, if any, attempts have been made to account for the possibility that a response shift may have occurred in the evaluation of HR-QOL. Most studies have compared HR-QOL scores of children with illness with their healthy peers. As such, there is a dearth of knowledge regarding the normative process of adaptation within the context of illness. It is recommended that researchers focus on gathering data using a relative standard of comparison. We further recommend that researchers interpret HR-QOL data in line with their intended purpose. Regarding developmental consideration, particular attention ought to be paid to developing instruments that consider children's emerging sense of self, cognitive capacity and emotional awareness. Instruments that include items that are age appropriate are more likely to maximise reliability and validity of reports.The results of many HR-QOL instruments are applied in pharmacotherapeutic and pharmacoeconomic assessments. However, there has been relative infrequent application of economically valid HR-QOL tools (utility scales) and the use of HR-QOL scales as outcome measures in paediatric drug trials. As such, few cost-utility analyses have been performed to inform paediatric decision making. In addition, many of the concerns in the development of HR-QOL instruments should also be applied to the utility scales such that they reflect adequately children's preferences for health states."+char(34)+"",

Reconstruction of the full basal turn was performed for both ears using a 1.0-mm layer, minimum intensity projection. The largest distance from the round window to the lateral wall (distance A) and the perpendicular distance (B) were measured. Distances were averaged between ears for each individual. In addition, 15 patients were implanted with the Nucleus 24 Contour Advance electrode array using a linear insertion depth of either 17 mm (n = 9) or 19 mm (n = 6). Postoperative X-rays were analyzed using the method of Xu et al.

Optimal treatment strategy has not been established yet. The objective of this review is to present and evaluate the current state of knowledge of CSOM.Design: Systematic narrative review.Methods: A PubMed search (1966-January 2005) was performed for studies on epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical. management, and complications of CSOM. All included articles were categorized according to level of evidence.Results: Five hundred and fifty papers were identified, of which 79 were found to be relevant for this review.

The usual factors, duration of profound HL (pHL), age, etiology, duration of CI experience, that are already known to have an influence, were included in the statistical analyses.Results: The significant factors were: the pure tone average threshold of the better ear, the brand of device, the percentage of active electrodes, the use of hearing aids (HAs) during the period of pHL, and the duration of mHL.Conclusions: A new model was designed showing a decrease of performance that started during the period of mHL, and became faster during the period of pHL. The use of bilateral HAs slowed down the related central reorganization that is the likely cause of the decreased performance.

		"Predictors of reading skill development in children with early cochlear implantation",
		"Objective: The present study sought to document the word reading and comprehension levels attained by children who were implanted by 5 yr of age. It was hypothesized that the improved speech perception abilities acquired with cochlear implantation would promote phonological coding skills and facilitate the acquisition of beginning reading skills.Design: Three subtests from diagnostic reading assessment batteries standardized on hearing children were administered to 181 children between 8 yr 0 mo and 9 yr 11 mo of age who had 4 to 6 yr of implant experience. In addition, a battery of processing measures was administered including a lexical decision task, a rhyme task and the digit span subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.Results: Over half of the children scored within the average range for their age compared with the normative data for hearing children. Reading competence was associated with higher nonverbal intelligence, higher family socio-economic status, female gender and later onset of deafness (between birth and 36 mo). After variance due to these child and family characteristics was removed, reading competence was associated with mainstream educational placement, use of an updated implant speech processor with a wide dynamic range, and speech processing characteristics that included longer memory span and use of phonological coding strategies. Reading outcome was most highly predicted by linguistic competence and, secondarily, by speech production skill.Conclusion: Children who experience severe to profound deafness early in their development have a better prognosis for normal literacy development than ever before. To the extent that use of a cochlear implant is associated with greater use of phonological coding strategies for decoding print, longer working memory spans for shortterm storage of phonemes, words and sentences and accelerated language development for reading comprehension, it should have a facilitative effect on the acquisition of literacy."+char(34)+"",

Twenty-eight prelinguistically deafened children who use a Nucleus cochlear implant were assigned to one of the three age groups, according to age at implantation: 2-5 yrs (N = 12), 5-8 yrs (N = 9), and 8-15 yrs (N = 7).

		"Objectives: A new technique for determining the position of each electrode in the cochlea is described and applied to spiral computed tomography data from 15 patients implanted with Advanced Bionics HiFocus I, Ij, or Helix arrays.Methods: ANALYZE imaging software was used to register 3-dimensional image volumes from patients' preoperative and postoperative scans and from a single body donor whose unimplanted ears were scanned clinically, with micro computed tomography and with orthogonal-plane fluorescence optical sectioning (OPFOS) microscopy. By use of this registration, we compared the atlas of OPFOS images of soft tissue within the body donor's cochlea with the bone and fluid/tissue boundary available in patient scan data to choose the midmodiolar axis position and judge the electrode position in the scala tympani or scala vestibuli, including the distance to the medial and lateral scalar walls. The angular rotation 0 degrees start point is a line joining the midmodiolar axis and the middle of the cochlear canal entry from the vestibule.Results: The group mean array insertion depth was 477 degrees (range, 286 degrees to 655 degrees). The word scores were negatively correlated (r = -0.59; p = .028) with the number of electrodes in the scala vestibuli.Conclusions: Although the individual variability in all measures was large, repeated patterns of suboptimal electrode placement were observed across subjects, underscoring the applicability of this technique."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: The purpose of this study was to conduct a large-scale investigation with adult recipients of the Clarion, Med-El, and Nucleus cochlear implant systems to (1) determine average scores and ranges of performance for word and sentence stimuli presented at three intensity levels (70, 60, and 50 dB SPL); (2) provide information on the variability of scores for each subject by obtaining testretest measures for all test conditions; and (3) further evaluate the potential use of lower speech presentation levels (i.e., 60 and/or 50 dB SPL) in cochlear implant candidacy assessment.Design: Seventy-eight adult cochlear implant recipients, 26 with each of the three cochlear implant systems, participated in the study. To ensure that the data collected reflect the range of performance of adult recipients using recent technology for the three implant systems (Clarion HiFocus I or 11, Aled-El Combi 40+, Nucleus 24M or 24R), a composite range and distribution of consonant-nucleusconsonant (CNC) monosyllabic word scores was determined. Subjects using each device were selected to closely represent this range and distribution of CNC performance. During test sessions, subjects were administered the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) sentence test and the CNC word test at three presentation levels (70, 60, and 50 dB SPL). HINT sentences also were administered at 60 dB SPL with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of +8 dB. Warble tones were used to determine sound-field threshold levels from 250 to 4000 Hz. Test-retest measures were obtained for each of the speech recognition tests as well as for warble-tone sound-field thresholds.Results: Cochlear implant recipients using the Clarion, Med-El, or Nucleus devices performed on average equally as well at 60 compared with 70 dB SPL when listening for words and sentences. Additionally, subjects had substantial open-set speech perception performance at the softer level of 50 dB SPL for the same stimuli; however, subjects' ability to understand speech was poorer when listening in noise to signals of greater intensity (60 dB SPL + 8 SNR) than when listening to signals presented at a soft presentation level (50 dB SPL) in quiet. A significant correlation was found between sound-field thresholds and speech recognition scores for presentation levels below 70 dB SPL. The results demonstrated a high test-retest reliability with cochlear implant users for these presentation levels and stimuli. Average sound-field thresholds were between 24 and 29 dB HL for frequencies of 250 to 4000 Hz, and results across sessions were essentially the same.Conclusions: Speech perception measures used with cochlear implant candidates and recipients should reflect the listening challenges that individuals encounter in natural communication situations. These data provide the basis for recommending new candidacy criteria based on speech recognition tests presented at 60 and/or 50 dB SPL, intensity levels that reflect real-life listening, rather than 70 dB SPL."+char(34)+"",

		"Most patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) are totally deaf after removal of their bilateral acoustic neuromas. Twenty-five patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 have been implanted with a brainstem electrode during surgery to remove an acoustic neuroma. The electrode is positioned in the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle, adjacent to the cochlear nuclei. The present electrode consists of three platinum plates mounted on a Dacron mesh backing, a design that has been demonstrated to be biocompatible and positionally stable in an animal model. Correct electrode placement depends on accurate identification of anatomic landmarks from the translabyrinthine surgical approach and also on intrasurgical electrophysiologic monitoring. Some tumors and their removal can result in significant distortion of the brainstem and surrounding structures. Even in the absence of identifiable anatomic landmarks, electrode location can be adjusted during surgical placement to find the location that maximizes the auditory evoked response and minimizes activation of other monitored cranial nerves. Stimulation of the electrodes produces auditory sensations in most patients, with results similar to those of single-channel cochlear implants. A coordinated multidisciplinary team is essential for successful application of an auditory brainstem implant."+char(34)+"",

Most experts use a combination of vitamins, optimize patients' nutrition and general health, and prevent worsening of symptoms during times of illness and physiologic stress. We agree with this approach, and we agree that therapies using vitamins and cofactors have value, though there is debate about the choice of these agents and the doses prescribed. Despite the paucity of high-quality scientific evidence, these therapies are relatively harmless, may alleviate select clinical symptoms, and theoretically may offer a means of staving off disease progression. Like many other mitochondrial medicine physicians, we have observed significant (and at times life-altering) clinical responses to such pharmacologic interventions. However, it is not yet proven that these therapies truly alter the course of the disease, and some experts may choose not to use these medications at all. At present, the evidence of their effectiveness does not rise to the level required for universal use.Based on our clinical experience and judgment, however, we agree that a therapeutic trial of coenzyme Q10, along with other antioxidants, should be attempted. Although individual specialists differ as to the exact drug cocktail, a common approach involves combinations of antioxidants that may have a synergistic effect. Because almost all relevant therapies are classified as medical foods or over-the-counter supplements, most physicians also attempt to balance the apparent clinical benefit of mitochondrial cocktails with the cost burden that these supplements pose for the family."+char(34)+"",

		"An exploratory look at pediatric cochlear implantation: Is earliest always best?",
		"Objectives: Since the advent of cochlear implants, age at implantation has declined as investigators report greater benefit the younger a child is implanted. Infants younger than 12 mos currently are excluded from Food and Drug Administration clinical trials, but have been implanted with Food and Drug Administration-approved devices. With a chance that an infant without profound hearing loss could be implanted because of the limitations of the diagnostic measures used with this population and the potential for additional anesthetic risks to infants younger than 1-yr-old, it is prudent to evaluate benefit in the youngest cochlear implant recipients. The goals of this research were to investigate whether significant gains are made by children implanted before 1-yr-old relative to those implanted at later ages, while controlling for potential covariates, and whether there is behavioral evidence for sensitive periods in spoken language development. It was expected that children implanted before age 1 yr would have more advanced spoken language skills than children implanted at later ages; there would be a negative relationship between age at implantation and rate of spoken language development, allowing for an examination of the effects of sensitive periods in spoken language development; and these trends would remain despite accounting for participant characteristics and experiences that might influence spoken language outcomes.Design: Ninety-six children with congenital profound sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally and no additional identified disabilities who were implanted before the age of 4 yrs were stratified into four groups based on age at implantation. Children's spoken language development was followed for at least 2 yrs after device activation. Spoken language scores and rate of development were evaluated along with four covariates (unaided pure-tone average, communication mode, gender, and estimated family income) as a function of age at implantation.Results: In general, the developmental trajectories of children implanted earlier were significantly better than those of children implanted later. However, the advantage of implanting children before 1-yr old versus waiting until the child was between 1 and 2 yrs was small and only was evident in receptive language development, not expressive language or word recognition development. Ago at implantation did not significantly influence the rate of the word recognition development, but did influence the rate of both receptive and expressive language acquisition: children implanted earlier in life had faster rates of spoken language acquisition than children implanted later in life.Conclusions: Although in general earlier cochlear implantation led to better outcomes, there were few differences in outcome between the small sample of six children implanted before 12 mos of age and those implanted at 13 to 24 mos. Significant performance differences remained among the other age groups despite accounting for potential confounds. Further, oral language development progressed faster in children implanted earlier rather than later in of life (up to age 4 yrs), whereas the rate of open-set speech recognition development was similar. Together, the results suggest that there is a sensitive period for spoken language during the first 4 yrs of life, but not necessarily for word recognition development during the same period."+char(34)+"",

		"The development and maintenance of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) appears to be supported by both neural activity and neurotrophins. Removal of this support leads to their gradual degeneration. Here, we examined whether the exogenous delivery of the neurotrophin brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in concert with electrical stimulation (ES) provides a greater protective effect than delivery of BDNF alone in vivo. The left cochlea of profoundly deafened guinea pigs was implanted with an electrode array and drug-delivery system. BDNF or artificial perilymph (AP) was delivered continuously for 28 days. ES induced neural activity in two cohorts (BDNF/ES and AP/ES), and control animals received BDNF or AP without ES (BDNF/- and AP/-). The right cochleae of the animals served as deafened untreated controls. Electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABRs) were recorded immediately following surgery and at completion of the drug-delivery period. AP/ES and AP/- cohorts showed an increase in EABR threshold over the implantation period, whereas both BDNF cohorts exhibited a reduction in threshold (P < 0.001, t-test). Changes in neural sensitivity were complemented by significant differences in both SGN survival and soma area. BDNF cohorts demonstrated a significant trophic or survival advantage and larger soma area compared with Ap-treated and deafened control cochleae; this advantage was greatest in the base of the cochlea. ES significantly enhanced the survival effects of BDNF throughout the majority of the cochlea (P < 0.05, Bonferroni s t-test), although there was no evidence of trophic support provided by ES alone. Cotreatment of SGNs with BDNF and ES provides a substantial functional and trophic advantage; this treatment may have important implications for neural prostheses.

		"Tissue injury by reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play a role in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Since iron is involved in ROS generation, we studied if an iron chelator, deferoxamine mesylate (DFO), alone or in combination with mannitol, a hydroxyl scavenger and weak iron chelator, attenuates NIHL. Further, we investigated if glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) provides additive or synergistic protection of the cochlea from acoustic trauma when given together with DFO and mannitol. Pigmented female guinea pigs were exposed to noise (4 kHz octave band, 115 dB SPL, 5 h). One hour before, immediately after, and 5 h after noise exposure, subjects received an injection of 5 mi saline/kg (control, group I), 100 mg DFO/kg (group II), 15 mg mannitol/kg (group III), or both DFO and mannitol (group IV and V). Animals in group V underwent implantation of an osmotic pump filled with GDNF (100 ng/ml) in the left ear 4 days before noise. Each treatment afforded some protection from noise damage. Group I showed significantly greater outer hair cell loss and threshold shifts at two or more frequencies compared to groups II through V. GDNF provided an additive functional, but not morphological, protection with DFO and mannitol. These findings indicate that iron chelators can attenuate NIHL, as do ROS scavengers, supporting the notion that ROS generation plays a role in NIHL. Additional functional protection provided with GDNF suggests that GDNF may attenuate noise-induced cochlear damage through a mechanism that is additive with antioxidants.

		"Cochlear implants and spoken language processing abilities: Review and assessment of the literature",
		"Cochlear implants (CIs) process sounds electronically and then transmit electric stimulation to the cochlea of individuals with sensorineural deafness, restoring some sensation of auditory perception. Many congenitally deaf CI recipients achieve a high degree of accuracy in speech perception and develop near-normal language skills. Post-lingually deafened implant recipients often regain the ability to understand and use spoken language with or without the aid of visual input (i.e. lip reading). However, there is wide variation in individual outcomes following cochlear implantation, and some CI recipients never develop useable speech and oral language skills. The causes of this enormous variation in outcomes are only partly understood at the present time. The variables most strongly associated with language outcomes are age at implantation and mode of communication in rehabilitation. Thus, some of the more important factors determining success of cochlear implantation are broadly related to neural plasticity that appears to be transiently present in deaf individuals. In this article we review the expected outcomes of cochlear implantation, potential predictors of those outcomes, the basic science regarding critical and sensitive periods, and several new research directions in the field of cochlear implantation."+char(34)+"",

		"Objectives-In this paper we test the concept of combining electrical stimulation for high-frequency sound with acoustic hearing for low-frequency information in the same ear. In addition, we test whether residual hearing can be preserved when an electrode is placed up to 10 mm into the inner ear, and whether the site of electrical stimulation influences speech perception.Material and Methods-Nine post-lingual adults with severe high-frequency hearing impairment were recruited to participate in the study. A single-subject clinical trial design was employed. A unique six-channel cochlear implant was designed for this clinical trial. The intracochlear electrodes were either 6 or 10 mm in length based on a Nucleus CI-24 multichannel implant. Monosyllabic word understanding and consonant identification in a recorded sound-only condition were used to assess changes in speech perception. Follow-up was > 12 months.Results-Acoustic hearing was preserved in all nine subjects. Preoperative monosyllabic word and sentence scores were unchanged in all subjects following implantation. A 30-40% improvement in consonant recognition occurred with the 10-min electrode. The 10-min electrode subjects were able to understand 83-90% of the monosyllabic words using the implant plus binaural hearing aids. Scores were more than doubled when compared to preoperative scores achieved with hearing aids only.Conclusions-The human car has the capability to integrate both acoustic and high-frequency electrically processed speech information. Placement of a short 10-mm electrode does not appear to damage residual low-frequency inner ear hair cell function, interfere with the micro-mechanics of normal cochlear vibration or decrease residual speech perception. The improvement in speech recognition was due primarily to the increased perception of higher-frequency consonantal speech cues. Such a device can provide a substantial benefit in terms of speech understanding to those with severe high-frequency hearing loss, while still maintaining the benefits of the residual lower-frequency acoustic hearing. The position of the electrode and the site of frequency information within the cochlea are shown to be important factors in the success of such a device."+char(34)+"",

		"Adaptive changes in early and late blind: A fMRI study of verb generation to heard nouns",
		"Literacy for blind people requires learning Braille. Along with others, we have shown that reading Braille activates visual cortex. This includes striate cortex (VI), i.e., banks of calcarine sulcus, and several higher visual areas in lingual, fusiform, cuneus, lateral occipital, inferior temporal, and middle temporal gyri. The spatial extent and magnitude of magnetic resonance (MR) signals in visual cortex is greatest for those who became blind early in life. Individuals who lost sight as adults, and subsequently learned Braille, still exhibited activity in some of the same visual cortex regions, especially VI. These findings suggest these visual cortex regions become adapted to processing tactile information and that this cross-modal neural change might support Braille literacy. Here we tested the alternative hypothesis that these regions directly respond to linguistic aspects of a task. Accordingly, language task performance by blind persons should activate the same visual cortex regions regardless of input modality. Specifically, visual cortex activity in blind people ought to arise during a language task involving heard words. Eight early blind, six late blind, and eight sighted subjects were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during covert generation of verbs to heard nouns. The control task was passive listening to indecipherable sounds (reverse words) matched to the nouns in sound intensity, duration, and spectral content. Functional responses were analyzed at the level of individual subjects using methods based on the general linear model and at the group level, using voxel based ANOVA and t-test analyses. Blind and sighted subjects showed comparable activation of language areas in left inferior frontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, and left posterior superior temporal gyri. The main distinction was bilateral, left dominant activation of the same visual cortex regions previously noted with Braille reading in all blind subjects. The spatial extent and magnitude of responses was greatest on the left in early blind individuals. Responses in the late blind group mostly were confined to V I and nearby portions of the lingual and fusiform gyri. These results confirm the presence of adaptations in visual cortex of blind people but argue against the notion that this activity during Braille reading represents somatosensory (haptic) processing. Rather, we suggest that these responses can be most parsimoniously explained in terms of linguistic operations. It remains possible that these responses represent adaptations which initially are for processing either sound or touch, but which are later generalized to the other modality during acquisition of Braille reading skills."+char(34)+"",

		"Several recent reports indicate that both localization and speech intelligibility in spatially separated noise are substantially improved by using cochlear implants (CIs) in both ears rather than in just one. Benefits appear to be largely derived from the effects of level variations at the two ears due to the head shadow whereas contributions from interaural time differences (ITDs) seem smaller than in normal hearing listeners. The effect of binaural unmasking estimated from speech studies to date varies from study to study and is possibly confounded by issues such as listening experience, bias or loudness effects when comparing the performance for the better ear with that using both ears. To improve the contribution from timing information at the two ears, it may be necessary to change present clinical sound-processing schemes that currently preserve only envelope cues so that they also preserve fine-timing information. However, recently published data show that basic psychophysical sensitivity to fine-timing ITDs in CI patients is very poor for rates beyond a few hundred hertz, suggesting that subjects do not actually hear ITD cues at those rates anyway. Data from a number of new studies are presented to discuss these and other issues related to the potential to benefit from bilateral implantation. Copyright (C) 2004 S.

		"Imaging findings of cochlear nerve deficiency",
		"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High-resolution T2-weighted fast spin-echo MR imaging provides excellent depiction of the cisternal and intracanalicular segments of the vestibulo-cochlear and facial nerves. Absence or reduction in caliber of the cochlear nerve (deficiency) has been described in association with congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Depiction of cochlear nerve integrity may be important for diagnosis and management of SNHL.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed high-resolution T2-weighted fast spin-echo MR images of 22 patients examined for SNHL who had deficiency of the cochlear nerve. Images were evaluated for the presence and comparative size of the component nerves (facial, cochlear, superior vestibular, and inferior vestibular nerves), relative size of the internal auditory canal (IAC), and any associated inner ear abnormalities. The clinical history, results of the clinical examination, and audiometric findings were reviewed for each patient.RESULTS: Deficiency of the cochlear nerve was observed in 12 patients with congenital SNHL and in 10 patients with acquired SNHL. Hypoplasia of the IAC was observed in association with congenital deficiency of the cochlear nerve in 11 of 12 patients. Deficiency of the cochlear nerve was observed in association with acoustic schwannoma in two cases and with acquired labyrinthine abnormalities in seven cases. Hypoplasia of the IAC was not observed in association with acquired SNHL.CONCLUSION: Deficiency of the cochlear nerve can be shown by high-resolution T2-weighted fast spin-echo MR imaging. Deficiency may be observed in association with congenital or acquired SNHL and may be important in the assessment of patients for cochlear implantation. Hypoplasia of the IAC is an indicator of congenital cochlear nerve deficiency."+char(34)+"",

		"Background Cochlear implants provide access to the speech signal in those profoundly deaf children who derive no material benefit from acoustic hearing aids. Speech perception after implantation can vary widely-we have analysed the contribution of several factors.Methods We examined 40 children with mean age at implantation of 52 months who were either born deaf or became deaf before 3 years. All patients received the same multichannel implant system and were followed up for 5 years. We used connected discourse tracking (CDT) as the measure of speech perception. The effect of five potential predictors (age at implantation, number of inserted electrodes, origin of deafness, mode of communication, and socioeconomic group) on speech perception was analysed.Findings The mean number of words per minute perceived increased from 0 before implantation to 44.8 (SD 24.3) 5 years after implantation. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed that children significantly progressed over time (p=0.001). Age at implantation was a significant covariate (p=0.01) and mode of communication was a significant between-individuals factor (p=0.04).Interpretation Young age at intervention and oral communication mode are the most important known determinants of later speech perception in young children after cochlear implantation. Early identification of candidate children necessitates implementation of universal neonatal screening programmes for hearing impairment."+char(34)+"",

		"Hearing after congenital deafness: Central auditory plasticity and sensory deprivation",
		"The congenitally deaf cat suffers from a degeneration of the inner ear. The organ of Corti bears no hair cells, yet the auditory afferents are preserved. Since these animals have no auditory experience, they were used as a model for congenital deafness. Kittens were equipped with a cochlear implant at different ages and electro-stimulated over a period of 2.0-5.5 months using a monopolar singlechannel compressed analogue stimulation strategy (VIENNA-type signal processor). Following a period of auditory experience, we investigated cortical field potentials in response to electrical biphasic pulses applied by means of the cochlear implant. In comparison to naive unstimulated deaf cats and normal hearing cats, the chronically stimulated animals showed larger cortical regions producing middle-latency responses at or above 300 muV amplitude at the contralateral as well as the ipsilateral auditory cortex. The cortex ipsilateral to the chronically stimulated ear did not show any signs of reduced responsiveness when stimulating the 'untrained' ear through a second cochlear implant inserted in the final experiment. With comparable duration of auditory training, the activated cortical area was substantially smaller if implantation had been performed at an older age of 5-6 months. The data emphasize that young sensory systems in cats have a higher capacity for plasticity than older ones and that there is a sensitive period for the cat's auditory system."+char(34)+"",

		"Principles of Local Drug Delivery to the Inner Ear",
		"As more and more substances have been shown in preclinical studies to be capable of preventing damage to the inner ear from exposure to noise, ototoxic drugs, ischemia, infection, inflammation, mechanical trauma and other insults, it is becoming very important to develop feasible and safe methods for the targeted delivery of drugs to specific regions in the inner ear. Recently developed methods for sampling perilymph from the cochlea have overcome major technical problems that have distorted previous pharmacokinetic studies of the ear. These measurements show that drug distribution in perilymph is dominated by passive diffusion, resulting in large gradients along the cochlea when drugs are applied intratympanically. Therefore, in order to direct drugs to specific regions of the ear, a variety of delivery strategies are required. To target drugs to the basal cochlear turn and vestibular system while minimizing exposure of the apical cochlear turns, single one-shot intratympanic applications are effective. To increase the amount of drug reaching the apical cochlear turns, repeated intratympanic injections or controlled-release drug delivery systems, such as biodegradable biopolymers or catheters and pumps, are more effective. However, if the applied substance does not easily pass through the round window membrane, or if a more widespread distribution of drug in the ear is required, then intralabyrinthine injections of the substance may be required. Intralabyrinthine injection procedures, which are currently in development in animals, have not yet been proven safe enough for human use. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel"+char(34)+"",

		"Objectives/Hypothesis: Cochlear implantation (CI) carries with it the potential risk for vestibular system insult or stimulation with resultant dysfunction. As candidate profiles continue to evolve and with the recent development of bilateral CI, understanding the significance of this risk takes on an increasing importance. Study Design. Between 1997 to 2001, a prospective observational study was carried out in a tertiary care medical center to assess the effects of unilateral CI on the vestibular system. Methods: Assessment was performed using the dizziness handicap inventory (DHI), vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) testing using both alternate bithermal caloric irrigations (ENG) and rotational chair-generated sinusoidal harmonic accelerations (SHA), and computerized dynamic platform posturography (CDP) at preoperative, 1-month, 4-month, 1-year and 2-year postimplantation visits. CI was carried out without respect to the preoperative vestibular function test results. Results. Specifically, 86 patients were entered into the study after informed consent. For the group as a whole, pair wise comparisons revealed few significant differences between preoperative and postoperative values for VOR testing (ENG and SHA) at any of the follow-up intervals. Likewise, DHI testing was also unchanged except for significant reductions (improvements) in the emotional subcategory scores at both the 4-month and 1-year intervals. CDP results demonstrated substantial improvements in postural sway in the vestibular conditions (5 and 6) as well as composite scores with the device "+char(34)+"off"+char(34)+" and "+char(34)+"on"+char(34)+" at the 1-month, 4-month, 1-year, and 2-year intervals. Device activation appeared to improve postural stability in some conditions. Excluding those patients with preoperative areflexic or hyporeflexic responses in the implanted ear (total [warm + cool] caloric response less than or equal to 15 deg/s), substantial reductions (greater than or equal to 21 deg/s maximum slow phase velocity) in total caloric response were observed for 8 (29%) patients at the 4- month interval. These persisted throughout the study period. These changes were accompanied by significant low frequency phase changes on SHA testing confirming a VOR insult. Of interest, no significant changes were detected in the DHI or CDP, and there were no effects of age, sex, device manufacturer, or etiology of hearing loss (HL) for these patients. Conclusions. Unilateral CI rarely results in significant adverse effects on the vestibular system as measured by the DHI, ENG, SHA, and CDP. On the contrary, patients that underwent CI experienced significant improvements in the objective measures of postural stability as measured by CDP. Device activation in music appeared to have an additional positive effect on postural stability during CDP testing. Although VOR testing demonstrated some decreases in response, patients did not suffer from disabling vestibular effects following CI. The mechanism underlying these findings remains speculative. These findings should be considered in counseling patients about CI. Key Words. Vestibular, cochlear implant, dizziness, electronystagmography, rotary chair, platform posturography."+char(34)+"",

On average, EAP thresholds fell at 53% of the MAP dynamic range. Correlations between EAP threshold and MAP T- and C-level improved substantially when combined with behavioral measures obtained from one electrode in the array.Conclusions: Moderate correlations were found between EAP thresholds and MAP T- and C-levels for the children participating in this study.

		"Objective: We investigated maturation of cortical auditory function in normal-hearing children and in children who receive stimulation of their auditory system through a cochlear implant.Design: As a measure of cortical auditory function, auditory evolved responses (AERs) were recorded from normal-hearing children and adults as well as from children and adults fitted with a cochlear implant. Morphological and latency changes for evoked responses recorded at electrode Cz are reported.Results: For normal-hearing children, there is a gradual evolution of AER features that extends through adolescence, with P-1 latency becoming adult-like in the late teens. Latency changes for P-1 occur at the same rate for implanted children, but the overall maturation sequence is delayed. By extrapolation from the existing data, the age at which P-1 latency becomes adult-like is delayed by approximately 5 yr for the implanted population. Other typical features of the AER, namely N-1 and P-2, are either delayed in developing or absent in the implanted children.Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest both similarities and differences in cortical auditory maturation for normal-hearing and implanted children. For implanted children, the 5 yr delay for maturation of P-1 latency roughly corresponds to the average 4.5 yr interval between the onset of deafness and the time of implantation. These findings suggest that during the period of deafness. maturation of cortical auditory function does not progress. However, some, if not all, maturational processes resume after stimulation is reintroduced."+char(34)+"",

Radiological features of malformations necessary to identify these problems preoperatively are discussed. Facial nerve abnormalities that may occur are described. Two different types of cerebrospinal fluid leakage are defined and necessary measures to prevent leakage are described. Standard and modified surgical approaches to overcome the described problems are described with literature findings. Finally meningitis which may occur with and without cochlear implantation in this special group of patients is emphasized. This is common in incomplete partition type I patients and is usually due to a fistula in one of the windows (usually oval window) which occurs as a result of cerebrospinal fluid pressure. This is a medical emergency leading to potential meningitis and measures that should be taken to stop the leak as soon as possible are described.",

Children who participated in the study (N = 147) demonstrated profound sensorineural hearing loss and had used cochlear implants for between 6 months and 10 years. Educational programs that used an oral communication (OC) approach focused on the development of spoken language, whereas educational programs that used a total communication (TC) approach focused on the development of language using both signed and spoken language. Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) we compared the consonant-production accuracy, receptive spoken vocabulary, and expressive spoken and/or signed vocabulary skills, over time, of children who were enrolled in schools that used either OC or TC approaches, while controlling for a number of variables. These variables included age at implantation, preoperative aided speech detection thresholds, type of cochlear implant device used, and whether a complete or incomplete active electrode army was implanted.The results of this study indicated that as they used their implants the children demonstrated improved consonant-production accuracy and expressive and receptive vocabulary over time, regardless of whether their school employed a TC or OC teaching method. Furthermore, there appeared to be a complex relationship among children's performance with the cochlear implant, age at implantation, and communication/teaching strategy employed by the school. Controlling for all variables, children in OC programs demonstrated, on average, superior consonant-production accuracy, with significantly greater rates of improvement in consonant-production accuracy scores over time compared to children in TC programs. However, there was no significant difference between OC and TC groups in performance or rate of growth in consonant-production accuracy when children received their implants before the age of 5 years. There was no significant difference between the OC and TC groups in receptive spoken vocabulary scores or in rate of improvement over time. However, children in the TC group achieved significantly higher receptive spoken vocabulary scores than children in the OC group if they received their implant before the age of 5 years. The TC group demonstrated superior scores and rates of growth on the expressive vocabulary measure (spoken and/or signed) when compared to the OC group if they received their implants during their preschool or early elementary school years. There was no significant difference if the children received their implants during middle elementary school. Regardless of whether children were in the OC or TC group children who received their implants during preschool demonstrated stronger performance, on average, on all measures over time than children who received their implants during their elementary school years.

Examination of the sural nerve and the auditory nerve adjacent to the brainstem showed marked loss of fibres with evidence of incomplete remyelination of some of the remaining fibres. Studies of auditory function in surviving family members using electrophysiological and psychoacoustic methods provided evidence that the hearing deficits in this form of auditory neuropathy were probably related to a decrease of auditory nerve input accompanying axonal disease.

Based on prolonged P-1 latencies compared to age-matched normal-hearing (NH) peers, these data suggested a delayed maturation nearly equivalent to the period of deafness. However, rates of maturation for this AEP peak were essentially the same in NH and CI children. This suggests that, given enough time, the AEPs of CI children would assume the characteristic morphology found in older NH teens and NH adults.

A second objective was to measure the change in localization performance in these adults between approximately 5 and 15 mo after activation. A third objective was to evaluate the relative roles of interaural level difference (ILD) and interaural temporal difference (ITD) cues in localization by these subjects.Design: Twenty-two adults, all postlingually deafened and all bilaterally fitted with MED-EL COMBI 40+ cochlear implants, were tested in a modified source identification task. Subjects were tested individually in an anechoic chamber, which contained an array of 43 numbered loudspeakers extending from -90 degrees to +90 degrees azimuth. On each trial, a 200-msec signal (either a noise burst or a speech sample) was presented from one of 17 active loudspeakers (span: +/- 80 degrees and the subject had to identify which source from the 43 loudspeakers in the array produced the signal. Subjects were tested in three conditions: left device only active, right device only active, and both devices active. Twelve of the 22 subjects were retested approximately 10 mo after their first test. In Experiment 2, the spectral content and rise-decay time of the noise stimulus were manipulated.Results: The relationship between source azimuth and response azimuth was characterized in terms of the adjusted constant error (0).

(3) As a group, the 12 subjects who were retested 10 mo after their first visit showed no significant improvement in localization performance during the intervening time. However, two subjects who performed very poorly during their first visit showed dramatic improvement (error scores were halved) over the intervening time. In Experiment 2, removing the high-frequency content of noise signals resulted in significantly poorer performance, but removing the low-frequency content or increasing the risedecay time did not have an effect.Conclusions: In agreement with previously reported data, subjects with bilateral cochlear implants localized sounds in the horizontal plane remarkably well when using both of their devices, but they generally could not localize sounds when either device was deactivated. They could localize the speech signal with slightly, but significantly better accuracy than the noise, possibly due to spectral differences in the signals, to the availability of envelope ITD cues with the speech but not the noise signal, or to more central factors related to the social salience of speech signals. For most subjects the remarkable ability to localize sounds has stabilized by 5 mo after activation. However, for some subjects who perform poorly initially, there can be substantial improvement past 5 mo. Results from Experiment 2 suggest that ILD cues underlie localization ability for noise signals, and that ITD cues do not contribute."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: To examine aspects of round window (RW) anatomy that are relevant to its use as a portal for atraumatic insertion of cochlear implant electrodes.Study Design: Anatomic study using human cadaveric temporal bones.Methods: A series of 30 temporal bones was dissected to permit microscopic study of the RW region.Results: The bony overhangs of the RW niche limit visibility of the RW membrane during surgery. Measurements of RW membrane area visible through a facial recess opening before and after drilling the overhangs in 15 temporal bones showed that RW membrane visibility is typically increased by a factor of 1.5 to 3 times after drilling and by as much as 13 times when the opening of the RW niche is relatively small. Observations from within the scale tympani in 15 cochlear dissections showed substantial variability in size of the RW opening available for electrode insertion. Area measurements of the portion of the RW covered by the vertical segment of the RW membrane ranged from 0.8 to 1.75 mm(2) in these specimens. In addition, irregularities in contour of the RW margin may make insertion challenging, which may necessitate drilling the anterior-inferior margin of the RW. Drilling in this region should be approached with care because of the close proximity of the cochlear aqueduct opening.Conclusion: RW insertion can be performed in a manner that is potentially less traumatic than the standard cochleostomy insertion. It may therefore be advantageous in cases in which hearing preservation is goal."+char(34)+"",

		"Speech, for most of us, is a bimodal percept whenever we both hear the voice and see the lip movements of a speaker. Children who are born deaf never have this bimodal experience. We tested children who had been deaf from birth and who subsequently received cochlear implants for their ability to fuse the auditory information provided by their implants with visual information about lip movements for speech perception. For most of the children with implants (92%), perception was dominated by vision when visual and auditory speech information conflicted. For some, bimodal fusion was strong and consistent, demonstrating a remarkable plasticity in their ability to form auditory-visual associations despite the atypical stimulation provided by implants. The likelihood of consistent auditory-visual fusion declined with age at implant beyond 2.5 years, suggesting a sensitive period for bimodal integration in speech perception."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: To evaluate the benefits of bilateral electrical stimulation for hearing-impaired adult subjects using the Nucleus 24 cochlear implant in a multicenter study, and to compare and quantify performance on speech perception measures in quiet and in noise and localization ability for unilateral and bilateral cochlear implant use.Design: Repeated single subject measures were carried out for each subject, with each subject serving as their own control. Assessment of unilateral and bilateral listening conditions for performance on tests of speech comprehension and sound localization were performed. Speech comprehension measures were performed in quiet at 0 degree azimuth and in the presence of background noise simultaneously presented from the same speaker and spatially separated by 90 degrees, at S+45degreesN45degrees and at S-45degreesN+45degrees. Test materials included Freiburger monosyllabic words, Oldenburger sentences, and the Hochmair- Schulz-Moser sentences. Tests of localization were performed in the horizontal plane with 12 speaker locations 30 degrees apart using a shortened sentence stimulus from the Hochmair-Schulz- Moser sentences at two possible presentation levels of 55 and 70 dB sound pressure level for assessment of directionality. The binaural advantage provided by bilateral stimulation was calculated with respect to each ear separately, classified as either the better or poorer performing ear for each speech material in quiet and in noise test conditions. For localization of sound, the binaural advantage was compared with left and right ears separately. Paired comparisons for performance data in all conditions were carried out by considering measurements for each subject in different conditions as paired observations and applying the Student's t test to determine the statistical difference between the data sets.Setting: Tertiary referral centers with a cochlear implant program.Patients: Thirty-seven profoundly hearing-impaired adults were enrolled in the study, 22 simultaneously and 15 sequentially bilaterally implanted. All patients received the Nucleus 24 cochlear implant and used the Nucleus Sprint or ESPrit 3G speech processor, with the vast majority using the ACE speech coding strategy.Results: For spatially separated speech in noise conditions, an interaural performance advantage for the ear closest to the speech source (i.e., with a superior signal to noise ratio) compared with that for the ear closest to the noise source (i.e., with an inferior signal to noise ratio) is consistently demonstrated regardless of whether it is the better or poorer performing ear closest to the speech signal. This is referred to as a significant binaural head-shadow benefit, resulting in a mean improvement between -10 dB and -11.4 dB in the critical signal to noise ratio required for 50% speech comprehension for the Oldenburger sentences and a mean improvement in the maximum score of 42% to 55% for the ear closest to the speech signal over the ear farthest away for the Hochmair-Schulz-Moser sentences. Bilateral stimulation is always observed to provide a performance advantage over the unilateral listening condition for either ear when ipsilateral to the noise source. In addition, as demonstrated by approximately half the subjects tested in noise with the Hochmair-Schulz-Moser sentences, a performance advantage of bilateral stimulation may be observed over the better ear alone when positioned ipsilateral to the speech signal, which is referred to as a binaural squelch effect. On average, for the group, this resulted in a statistically significant improvement in speech comprehension scores of 8% in the bilateral listening condition compared with the scores for the better ear alone. Through assessment of comprehension of coincidental speech in noise and speech in quiet, a significant benefit of binaural redundancy was noted for the group for Oldenburger sentence scores in noise and in quiet compared with unilateral scores for either ear and for the Freiburger monosyllabic words in quiet in comparison with the better ear alone scores. Binaural stimulation also led to a significant improvement in localization ability over either monaural condition, with the root mean square degrees of error reduced by 38 degrees compared with that observed for unilateral stimulation.Conclusion: Similar to what has been observed for bilateral acoustic stimulation in the past, bilateral electrical Stimulation provides the foundation for the potential advantages of the head-shadow effect, providing a binaural head-shadow benefit 959 and binaural auditory processing such as binaural redundancy and binaural squelch effects, all of which combine to lead to improved speech comprehension over unilateral listening conditions. The combination of improved speech comprehension and improved localization ability made available through bilateral electrical stimulation provides the necessary foundation to further assist the hearing-impaired listener to better cope with communication in the everyday listening situation both in noise and in quiet."+char(34)+"",

In addition, to investigate the extent to which a hearing aid in the nonimplanted ear can also provide benefits on this task.Design: Two groups of children participated, 13 with BI cochlear implants (cochlear implant + cochlear implant), ranging in age from 3 to 16 yrs, and six with a hearing aid in the nonimplanted ear (cochlear implant + hearing aid), ages 4 to 14 yrs. Testing was conducted in large sound-treated booths with loudspeakers positioned on a horizontal arc with a radius of 1.5 m. Stimuli were spondaic words recorded with a male voice. Stimulus levels typically averaged 60 dB SPL and were randomly roved between 56 and 64 dB SPL ( 4 dB rove); in a few instances, levels were held fixed (60 dB SPL). Testing was conducted by using a "+char(34)+"listening game"+char(34)+" platform via computerized interactive software, and the ability of each child to discriminate sounds presented to the right or left was measured for loudspeakers subtending various angular separations. Minimum audible angle thresholds were measured in the BI (cochlear implant + cochlear implant or cochlear implant + hearing aid) listening mode and under monaural conditions.Results: Approximately 70% (9/13) of children in the cochlear implant + cochlear implant group discriminated left/right for source separations of <= 20 degrees and, of those, 77% (7/9) performed better when listening bilaterally than with either cochlear implant alone. Several children were also able to perform the task when using a single cochlear implant, under some conditions. Minimum audible angle thresholds were better in the first cochlear implant than the second cochlear implant listening mode for nearly all (8/9) subjects. Repeated testing of a few individual subjects over a 2-yr period suggests that robust improvements in performance occurred with increased auditory experience. Children who wore hearing aids in the nonimplanted ear were at times also able to perform the task. Average group performance was worse than that of the children with III cochlear implants when both ears were activated (cochlear implant + hearing aid versus cochlear implant + cochlear implant) but not significantly different when listening with a single cochlear implant.Conclusions: Children with sequential BI cochlear implants represent a unique population of individuals who have undergone variable amounts of auditory deprivation in each ear. Our findings suggest that many but not all of these children perform better on measures of localization acuity with two cochlear implants compared with one and are better at the task than children using the cochlear implant + hearing aid. These results must be interpreted with caution, because benefits on other tasks as well as the long-term benefits of BI cochlear implants are yet to be fully understood. The factors that might contribute to such benefits must be carefully evaluated in large populations of children using a variety of measures."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective. The aim of this study was to investigate 1) whether a hearing aid needs to be adjusted differently depending on whether a child wears a cochlear implant or another hearing aid in the contralateral ear; 2) whether the use of a hearing aid and a cochlear implant in opposite ears leads to binaural interference; and 3) whether the use of a hearing aid and a cochlear implant in opposite ears leads to binaural benefits in speech perception, localization, and communicative functioning in real life.Design: Sixteen children participated in this study. All children used a Nucleus 22 or Nucleus 24 cochlear implant system programmed with the SPEAK strategy in one ear. The hearing aid amplification requirements in the nonimplanted ear of these children were determined using two procedures. A paired comparison technique was used to identify the frequency response that was best for speech intelligibility in quiet, and a loudness balancing technique was used to match the loudness of speech in the ear with a hearing aid to that with a cochlear implant. Eleven of the +/-6 children participated in the investigation of binaural effects. Performance in speech perception, localization, and communicative functioning was assessed under four aided conditions: cochlear implant with hearing aid as worn, cochlear implant alone, hearing aid alone, and cochlear implant with hearing aid adjusted according to individual requirements.Results. Fifteen of the 16 children whose amplification requirements were determined preferred a hearing aid frequency response that was within +/- 6 dB/octave of the NAL-RP prescription. On average, the children required 6 dB more gain than prescribed to balance the loudness of the implanted ear for a speech signal presented at 65 dB SPL. For all 11 children whose performance was evaluated for investigating binaural effects, there was no indication of significantly poorer performance under bilaterally aided conditions compared with unilaterally aided conditions. On average, there were significant benefits in speech perception, localization, and aural/oral function when the children used cochlear implants with adjusted hearing aids than when they used cochlear implants alone. All individuals showed benefits in at least one of the measures.Conclusions: Hearing aids for children who also use cochlear implants can be selected using the NAL-RP prescription. Adjustment of hearing aid gain to match loudness in the implanted ear can facilitate integration of signals from both ears, leading to better speech perception. Given that there are binaural advantages from using cochlear implants with hearing aids in opposite ears, clinicians should advise parents and other professionals about these potential advantages, and facilitate bilateral amplification by adjusting hearing aids after stable cochlear implant MAPs are established."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective. Only a small percentage of auditory brainstem implant (ABI) recipients treated for neurofibromatosis type 2 (NT2) have proved capable of identifying words using only the sound from the ABI. Recently, the ABI was applied to a series of patients with no cochlear nerve or with cochlear disorders that could not benefit from a cochlear implant (i.e., cochlear nerve aplasia or posttraumatic avulsion) or whose benefit was or would be severely compromised. A significant number of these patients have proven capable of understanding speech, including effortless telephone use. In the present study, a series of psychophysical tests were administered to determine the cause of the difference in performance between tumor (T) and nontumor (NT) ABI patients. Study Design. Retrospective case review. Setting. Tertiary referral center. Patients. Twenty patients with ABIs participated in the investigation. Ten were NF2 patients and 10 NT subjects. Patient ages ranged from 24 to 61 years. Eleven were males and nine females. Intervention: Auditory rehabilitation in auditory disconnection caused by cochlea or cochlear nerve disorders. Results: There was a significant correlation between modulation detection thresholds and speech understanding and a significant difference in modulation detection between T and NIT patients. Conclusions. The difference in modulation detection between the two groups suggests a difference in the survival of specific cells in the cochlear nucleus that support modulation. The pattern of results indicates a separate pathway of auditory processing that is specialized for modulated sounds, and that pathway is critical for speech understanding. In NF2 patients, the tumor and surgery may selectively damage this pathway, resulting in poor speech recognition with prosthetic stimulation."+char(34)+"",

The current study also describes the management and sequelae of each complication.Study Design: Prospective study assessing the surgical findings and complications of deaf children undergoing implantation.Setting: Pediatric tertiary referral center for cochlear implantation.Patients: The present study includes 300 consecutive children undergoing implantation, with a mean age at implantation of 5.1 years, ranging from 1.3 to 16.9 years. Of these children, 196 (65%) had congenital deafness of unknown cause. The commonest known cause was meningitis (73 of 300 [24%]) followed by congenital cytomegalovirus infection (17 of 300 [6%]). Children have been followed up regularly after implantation, typically at yearly intervals after the first year. The mean duration of follow-up at the time of the study was 4 years (range, 0.1-14 yr).Results: There were no major perioperative (within 1 d after surgery) or major early postoperative (within 1 wk after surgery) complications. In the same periods, there were 19 and 15 minor complications, respectively. These complications (e.g., eardrum perforation, hematoma, flap swelling, wound infection, temporary facial weakness) settled with conservative treatment or minor intervention. With regard to the late surgical complications (>1 wk after surgery), there were 7 major (e.g., severe flap infection requiring explantation, cholesteatoma, persistent eardrum perforation) and 14 minor complications (e.g., mild flap infection, flap swelling, hematoma). A number of complications were encountered even 14 years after the original operation, and some of them needed repeated interventions, highlighting the importance of long-term follow-up. However, most of the complications occurred very close to the surgical procedure (<1 yr).Conclusion: An overall rate of 2.3% for major surgical complications and an overall rate of 16% for minor surgical complications suggest that cochlear implantation is a relatively safe surgical operation in experienced centers. Most surgical complications are minor and can be managed with conservative treatment or minor surgical intervention. However, meticulous attention to surgical detail, especially handling soft tissues and leaving the posterior canal wall intact, and long-term follow-up are of paramount importance in minimizing the incidence of surgical complications."+char(34)+"",

		"Conclusions. With recent increased interest in minimizing intracochlear trauma and preserving residual hearing during cochlear implantation, increased attention must be paid to the cochleostomy site. The results of this paper demonstrate that the cochleostomy must be made inferior, rather than anterior, to the round window to ensure scala tympani insertion and to decrease the likelihood of insertion-induced intracochlear damage during electrode insertion. Objective. To describe the complex anatomy of the hook region of the cochlea, specifically in relation to the optimal placement of the cochleostomy for cochlear implant electrode insertion to potentially achieve hearing preservation. The authors believe that previous industry recommendations and described surgical techniques have resulted in cochleostomies being placed in anatomical positions that possibly result in electrode insertions that damage the basilar membrane and/or other cochlear structures. Material and methods. The results of a number of temporal bone studies were reviewed with attention being paid to the anatomical relationship of the basilar membrane and spiral ligament to the round window membrane. For different cochleostomy sites the potential for damage to intracochlear structures, particularly the basilar membrane and organ of Corti, was assessed. Results. The review of electrode insertion studies into human temporal bones, as well as a post-mortem anatomical study of implanted temporal bones, showed an increased risk of scala vestibuli insertions and insertion-induced damage to intracochlear structures when the cochleostomy was performed more anterior to the round window. These results were endorsed by studies detailing the anatomy of the hook region of the cochlea."+char(34)+"",

From the postoperative scan, intracochlear electrode location was determined and using rigid registration, transformed back to the preoperative computed tomography which had intracochlear anatomy (scala tympani and scala vestibuli) specified using a statistical shape model based on 10 microCT scans of human cadaveric cochleae. Likelihood ratio chi-square statistics were used to evaluate for differences in electrode placement with respect to surgical approach (C, RW, ERW) and type of electrode (LW, PM).ResultsElectrode placement completely within the scala tympani (ST) was more common for LW than were PM designs (89% vs. 58%; P<0.001). RW and ERW approaches were associated with lower rates of electrode placement outside the ST than was the cochleostomy approach (9%, 16%, and 63%, respectively; P<0.001). This pattern held true regardless of whether the implant was LW or PM. When examining electrode placement and hearing outcome, those with electrode residing completely within the ST had better consonant-nucleus-consonant word scores than did patients with any number of electrodes located outside the ST (P=0.045).ConclusionThese data suggest that RW and ERW approaches and LW electrodes are associated with an increased likelihood of successful ST placement.

In hearing cats, LFPs elicited by electrical intracochlear stimulation demonstrated developmental changes in mid-latency range, including reductions in peak and onset latencies of individual waves and a maturation of their shape and latencies during the first 2 months of life. In long latency range (> 80 ms), the P-1/N-1 response appeared after the fourth week of life and further increased in amplitude and decreased in latency, reaching mature shapes between the fourth and sixth months after birth (p.n.). Cortical activated areas became increasingly smaller during the first 3 months of life, reaching mature values at the fourth month p.n. The layer-specific pattern of synaptic activity matured 4 months p.n. In congenitally deaf cats, the developmental pattern was different. The lowest cortical LFP thresholds were significantly smaller than in hearing controls, demonstrating a 'hypersensitivity' to sensory inputs. The development of N-b waves was delayed and altered and the long latency responses became smaller than in controls at the second and third months. The activated areas remained smaller than in controls until the third month, then they increased rapidly and exceeded the activated areas of age-matched controls. From the fourth month on, the activated areas decreased again and smaller synaptic currents were found in deaf cats than in controls.

Adults received their devices in a simultaneous procedure and children in sequential procedures (3-8 years apart). Adults underwent testing of sound localization and speech intelligibility, with a single Cl and bilaterally. Children underwent testing of sound localization, right/left discrimination, and speech intelligibility, with the first Cl alone and bilaterally. We used computer games to attract the children's attention and engage them in the psychophysical tasks for long periods of time.Results: Preliminary findings suggest that, for adults, bilateral hearing leads to better performance on the localization task, and on the speech task when the noise is near the poorer of the 2 ears. In children, localization and discrimination are slightly better under bilateral conditions, but not remarkably so. On the speech tasks, 1 child did not benefit from bilateral hearing. Two children showed consistent improvement with bilateral hearing when the noise was near the side that underwent implantation first.Conclusions: Bilateral CIs may offer advantages to some listeners. The tasks described in this study might offer a powerful tool for measuring such advantages, especially in young children.

Similar rates of recovery were observed in the three good performers (time constant approximately 70 ms). In contrast, subject N3's recovery function shows a more rapid recovery.

In addition, radiography of the implanted devices was performed and correlated to histologic results. Electrode positions and trauma to cochlear structures were then evaluated histologically. Results: All insertions of the new electrode array were performed in the scala tympani of the cochlea. All insertions were atraumatic and covered one cochlear turn. The only effect on cochlear structures that could be observed was a slight lifting of the basilar membrane in the middle turn limited to the tip of the electrode. In three bones, basal trauma, which resulted from the cochleostomy itself, could be observed as well. All neural structures remained intact. Conclusions: The new electrode prototype provides very good mechanical properties for safe and atraumatic implantation. All criteria for the use in hearing-preservation cochlear implantation for electric and acoustic stimulation were fulfilled. Surgical measures to prevent basal trauma appear to be very important."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: The primary goal of this study was to examine changes that may occur in electrode impedance, electrically evoked compound action potential (EAP) threshold and slope of the EAP growth function, and behavioral measures of threshold (MAP T-level) and maximum comfort (Clevel) over time in both adult and child cochlear implant users. Secondary goals were to determine whether changes in these measures are consistent between children and adults, and to determine whether behavioral measures (MAP T- and C-levels) and electrophysiologic measures (EAP thresholds) exhibit the same trends over time.Design: Thirty-five children and 33 adults implanted with the Nucleus CI24M between November 1996 and August 1999 participated in this study. Subjects were included in this study if 1) they had used their implant for at least 1 yr after device connection, and 2) they had participated in the necessary data collection at a minimum number of the time intervals assessed in this study. EAP threshold, slope of the EAP growth function, and common ground electrode impedance measures were collected intraoperatively, at initial stimulation, and at several subsequent visits up to 2 yr post initial stimulation. MAP T- and C-levels were measured at initial stimulation and at the same time intervals as described above.Results: Changes in electrode impedance, EAP thresholds, and slope of the EAP growth function from measures made intraoperatively, at initial stimulation, and at 1 to 2 mo post initial stimulation were similar in both children and adults. Beyond the 1- to 2-mo visit, children exhibited significant increases in electrode impedance, EAP thresholds, slope, and MAP T-levels, whereas these same measures in adults remained relatively stable. EAP thresholds in children stabilized by the 3- to 8-mo visit, and electrode impedance stabilized by the 6- to 8-mo visit, while slope of the EAP growth function, MAP T-levels, and MAP C-levels were stable by 1 yr post initial stimulation. C-levels in adults increased up to 1 yr post initial stimulation; however, the amount of increase was much smaller than that seen in children. In both children and adults, longitudinal trends in EAP thresholds mirrored T-level more closely than C-level.Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that peripheral changes occur in many children that do not generally occur in adults within the first year of cochlear implant use. One implication of these results is that if EAP thresholds are to be used to assist in programming the speech processor for children, it is best to make those measures at the same time interval as device programming rather than using measures made intraoperatively or at the initial programming session to set MAP levels at later visits."+char(34)+"",

		"Outcomes of Early- and Late-Identified Children at 3 Years of Age: Findings From a Prospective Population-Based Study",
		"Objective: To address the question of whether, on a population level, early detection and amplification improve outcomes of children with hearing impairment.Design: All families of children who were born between 2002 and 2007, and who presented for hearing services below 3 years of age at Australian Hearing pediatric centers in New South Wales, Victoria, and Southern Queensland were invited to participate in a prospective study on outcomes. Children's speech, language, functional, and social outcomes were assessed at 3 years of age, using a battery of ageappropriate tests. Demographic information relating to the child, family, and educational intervention was solicited through the use of custom-designed questionnaires. Audiological data were collected from the national database of Australian Hearing and records held at educational intervention agencies for children. Regression analysis was used to investigate the effects of each of 15 predictor variables, including age of amplification, on outcomes.Results: Four hundred and fifty-one children enrolled in the study, 56% of whom received their first hearing aid fitting before 6 months of age. On the basis of clinical records, 44 children (10%) were diagnosed with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder. There were 107 children (24%) reported to have additional disabilities. At 3 years of age, 317 children (70%) were hearing aid users and 134 children (30%) used cochlear implants. On the basis of parent reports, about 71% used an aural/oral mode of communication, and about 79% used English as the spoken language at home. Children's performance scores on standardized tests administered at 3 years of age were used in a factor analysis to derive a global development factor score. On average, the global score of hearing-impaired children was more than 1 SD below the mean of normal-hearing children at the same age. Regression analysis revealed that five factors, including female gender, absence of additional disabilities, less severe hearing loss, higher maternal education, and (for children with cochlear implants) earlier age of switch-on were associated with better outcomes at the 5% significance level. Whereas the effect of age of hearing aid fitting on child outcomes was weak, a younger age at cochlear implant switch-on was significantly associated with better outcomes for children with cochlear implants at 3 years of age.Conclusions: Fifty-six percent of the 451 children were fitted with hearing aids before 6 months of age. At 3 years of age, 134 children used cochlear implants and the remaining children used hearing aids. On average, outcomes were well below population norms. Significant predictors of child outcomes include: presence/absence of additional disabilities, severity of hearing loss, gender, maternal education, together with age of switch-on for children with cochlear implants."+char(34)+"",

All participants had either used a hearing aid in the nonimplanted ear for at least 75% of waking hours after cochlear implantation, and/or, hearing loss less than 90 dB HL in the low frequencies in the nonimplanted ear. Speech perception was evaluated in 3 conditions: cochlear implant alone (CI), hearing aid alone (HA), and cochlear implant in conjunction with hearing aid in opposite ears (CIHA). Three speech perception tests were used:constant-vowel nucleus-consonant (CNC) words in quiet, City University of New York style (CUNY) sentences in coincident signal and noise, and spondees in coincidental and spatially separated signal and Information transmission analyses were performed on the CNC responses. noise.Of the 14 participants tested, 6 showed significant bimodal benefit on open-set speech perception measures and 5 showed benefit on closeset spondees. However, 2 participants showed poorer speech perception with CIHA than CI in at least 1 of the speech perception tests. Results of information transmission analyses showed that bimodal benefit (performance with CIHA minus that with CI) in quiet arises from improved perception of the low frequency components in speech. Results showed that participants with poorer aided thresholds in the mid-to-high frequencies demonstrated greater bimodal benefit. It is possible that the mid-to-high frequency information provided by the hearing aids may be conflicting with the cochlear implants."+char(34)+"",

		"Recognition of spectrally degraded and frequency-shifted vowels in acoustic and electric hearing",
		"The present study measured the recognition of spectrally degraded and frequency-shifted vowels in both acoustic and electric hearing. Vowel stimuli were passed through 4, 8, or 16 bandpass filters and the temporal envelopes from each filter band were extracted by half-wave rectification and low-pass filtering. The temporal envelopes were used to modulate noise bands which were shifted in frequency relative to the corresponding analysis filters. This manipulation not only degraded the spectral information by discarding within-band spectral detail, but also shifted the tonotopic representation of spectral envelope information. Results from five normal-hearing subjects showed that vowel recognition was sensitive to both spectral resolution and frequency shifting. The effect of a frequency shift did not interact with spectral resolution, suggesting that spectral resolution and spectral shifting are orthogonal in terms of intelligibility. High vowel recognition scores were observed for as few as four bands. Regardless of the number of bands, no significant performance drop was observed for tonotopic shifts equivalent to 3 mm along the basilar membrane, that is, for frequency shifts of 40%-60%. Similar results were obtained from five cochlear implant listeners, when electrode locations were fixed and the spectral location of the analysis filters was shifted. Changes in recognition performance in electrical and acoustic hearing were similar in terms of the relative location of electrodes rather than the absolute location of electrodes, indicating that cochlear implant users may at least partly accommodate to the new patterns of speech sounds after long-time exposure to their normal speech processor.

		"Is there a critical period for cochlear implantation in congenitally deaf children? Analyses of hearing and speech perception performance after implantation",
		"A range of basic and applied studies have demonstrated that during the development of the auditory system, early experimental manipulations or clinical interventions are generally more effective than those made later We present a short review of these studies. We investigated this age-related plasticity in relation to the timing of cochlear implantation in deaf-from-birth children. Cochlear implantation is a standard intervention for providing hearing in children with severe to profound deafness. An important practical question is whether there is a critical period or cutoff age of implantation after which hearing outcomes are significantly reduced. In this article, we present data from prelingually deaf children (mostly congenitally deaf) implanted at ages ranging from 1 to 15 years. Each child was tested with auditory and speech understanding tests before implantation, and at regular intervals up to 8 years postimplantation. We measured the improvement in performance of speech understanding tests in younger implanted children and compared it with the results of those implanted at a later age. We also used a binary partitioning algorithm to divide the data systematically at all ages at implant to determine the optimum split, i.e., to determine the age at implant which best separates performance of early implanted versus later implanted children. We observed distinct age-of-implant cutoffs, and will discuss whether these really represent critical periods during development. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."+char(34)+"",

		"The differences in spectral shape resolution abilities among cochlear implant (CI) listeners, and between CI and normal-hearing (NH) listeners; when listening with the same number of channels (12), was investigated. In addition, the effect of the number of channels on spectral shape resolution was examined. The stimuli were rippled noise signals with various ripple frequency-spacings. An adaptive 4IFC procedure was used to determine the threshold for resolvable ripple spacing, which was the spacing at which an interchange in peak and valley positions could be discriminated. The results showed poorer spectral shape resolution in CI compared to NH listeners (average thresholds of approximately 3000 and 400 Hz, respectively), and wide variability among CI listeners (range of approximately 800 to 8006 Hz). There was a significant relationship between spectral shape resolution and vowel recognition. The spectral shape resolution thresholds of NH listeners increased as the number of channels increased from 1 to 16, while the CI listeners showed a performance plateau at 4-6 channels, which is consistent with previous results using speech recognition measures. These results indicate that this test may provide a measure of CI performance which is time efficient and non-linguistic, and therefore, if verified, may provide a useful contribution to the prediction of speech perception in adults and children who use CIs.

		"Objective: To develop techniques for measuring the positions of the individual electrodes of a multiple channel cochlear implant and for estimating associated characteristic frequencies.Background: Information concerning the positions of the individual electrodes of a cochlear implant array is important for analyzing speech perception or psychophysical data and for optimizing speech-processing strategies. This study presents two techniques for obtaining such information from postoperative plain film radiographs.Methods: A template spiral shape, derived from analysis of the radiographs of 30 cochlear implant patients, is used to obtain measurements of the angular positions of the electrode bands within scala tympani. A research technique measures angular positions and estimates characteristic frequencies for all electrode bands but requires that the positions of two cochlear landmarks and all electrode bands be digitized. A clinical technique provides similar angle and frequency estimates but requires a minimum of information to be extracted visually from the radiograph. The lateral positions of the bands are estimated, in the research technique, using mean outer and inner wall functions obtained from 11 Silastic molds of scala tympani.Results: The mean position of the implanted array relative to the mean scala tympani outer wall function was consistent with published histologic observations of implanted temporal bones. Measured angles did not vary greatly with experimenter or with rotation of the cochlea relative to the radiographic beam by up to 20 degrees.Conclusions: The techniques described allow, principally, measurement of the longitudinal positions of the bands of a cochlear implant in scala tympani and estimation of corresponding characteristic frequencies."+char(34)+"",

For this group of candidates, conventional hearing aids often neither provided sufficient amplification nor were they considered suitable for cochlear implantation due to the possible destruction of residual hearing capabilities. With EAS, combining electric stimulation with an ipsilateral acoustic stimulation, preservation of residual LFH and the development of a new speech processor uniting both strategies became essential. Over the last years, EAS has developed further and advanced in electrode design and surgery techniques.

		"The functional status of central neural pathways, in particular their susceptibility to plasticity and functional reorganization, may influence speech performance of deaf cochlear implant users. In this paper, we sought to determine how brain metabolic activity measured before implantation relates to cochlear implantation outcome, that is, speech perception. In 22 prelingually deaf children between 1 and 11 years, we correlated preoperative glucose metabolism as measured by F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with individual speech perception performance assessed 3 years after implantation, while factoring out the confounding effect of age at implantation. Whereas age at implantation was positively correlated with increased activity in the right superior temporal gyrus, speech scores were selectively associated with enhanced metabolic activity in the left prefrontal cortex and decreased metabolic activity in right Heschl's gyrus and in the posterior superior temporal sulcus. These results reinforce the notion that implantation should be performed as early as possible to prevent cross-modal takeover of auditory regions and suggest that rehabilitation strategies may be more efficient if they capitalize on general cognitive functions instead of only targeting specialized circuits dedicated to auditory and audiovisual pattern recognition."+char(34)+"",

		"The Speech Transmission Index (STI) is a physical. metric that is well correlated with the intelligibility of speech degraded by additive noise and reverberation. The traditional STI uses modulated noise as a probe signal and is valid for assessing degradations that result from linear operations on the speech signal. Researchers have attempted to extend the STI to predict the intelligibility of nonlinearly processed speech by proposing variations that use speech as a probe signal. This work considers four previously proposed speech-based STI methods and four novel methods, studied under conditions of additive noise, reverberation, and two nonlinear operations (envelope thresholding and spectral subtraction). Analyzing intermediate metrics in the STI calculation reveals why some methods fail for nonlinear operations. Results indicate that none of the previously proposed methods is adequate for all of the conditions considered, while four proposed methods produce qualitatively reasonable results and warrant further study.

		"Objectives: Clinical trials in which children received bilateral cochlear implants in sequential operations were conducted to analyze the extent to which bilateral implantation offers benefits on a number of measures. The present investigation was particularly focused on measuring the effects of age at implantation and experience after activation of the second implant on speech perception performance.Study Design: Thirty children aged 3 to 13 years were recipients of 2 cochlear implants, received in sequential operations, a minimum of 6 months apart. All children received their first implant before 5 years of age and had acquired speech perception capabilities with the first device. They were divided into 3 age groups on the basis of age at time of second ear implantation: Group I, 3 to 5 years; Group II, 5.1 to 8 years; and Group III, 8.1 to 13 years. Speech perception measures in quiet included the Multisyllabic Lexical Neighborhood Test (MLNT) for Group I, the Lexical Neighborhood Test (LNT) for Groups II and III, and the Hearing In Noise Test for Children (HINTC) sentences in quiet for Group III. Speech perception in noise was assessed using the Children's Realistic Intelligibility and Speech Perception (CRISP) test. Testing was performed preoperatively and again postactivation of the second implant at 3, 6, and 12 months (CRISP at 3 and 9 mo) in both the unilateral and bilateral conditions in a repeated-measures study design. Two-way repeatedmeasures analysis of variance was used to analyze statistical significance among device configurations and performance over time.Setting: US Multicenter.Results: Results for speech perception in quiet show that children implanted sequentially acquire open-set speech perception in the second ear relatively quickly (within 6 mo). However, children younger than 8 years do so more rapidly and to a higher level of speech perception ability at 12 months than older children (mean second ear MLNT/LNT scores at 12 months: Group 1, 83.9%; range, 71-96%; Group II, 59.5%; range, 40-88%; Group III, 32%; range, 12-56%). The second-ear mean HINT-C score for Group III children remained far less than that of the first ear even after 12 months of device use (44 versus 89%; t, 6.48; p < 0.001; critical value, 0.025). Speech intelligibility for spondees in noise was significantly better under bilateral conditions than with either ear alone when all children were analyzed as a single group and for Group III children. At the 9-month test interval, performance in the bilateral configuration was significantly better for all noise conditions (13.2% better for noise at first cochlear implant, 6.8% better for the noise front and noise at second cochlear implant conditions, t = 2.32, p = 0.024, critical level = 0.05 for noise front; t = 3.75, p < 0.0001, critical level = 0.05 for noise at first implant; t = 2.73, p = 0.008, critical level = 0.05 for noise at second implant side). The bilateral benefit in noise increased with time from 3 to 9 months after activation of the second implant. This bilateral advantage is greatest when noise is directed toward the first implanted ear, indicating that the head shadow effect is the most effective binaural mechanism. The bilateral condition produced small improvements in speech perception in quiet and for individual Group I and Group II patient results in noise that, in view of the relatively small number of subjects tested, do not reach statistical significance.Conclusion: Sequential bilateral cochlear implantation in children of diverse ages has the potential to improve speech perception abilities in the second implanted ear and to provide access to the use of binaural mechanisms such as the head shadow effect. The improvement unfolds over time and continues to grow during the 6 to 12 months after activation of the second implant. Younger children in this study achieved higher open-set speech perception scores in the second ear, but older children still demonstrate bilateral benefit in noise. Determining the longterm impact and cost-effectiveness that results from such potential capabilities in bilaterally implanted children requires additional study with larger groups of subjects and more prolonged monitoring."+char(34)+"",

Methods: Forty-seven patients aged 50 to 80 years (mean age, 63.4 y [SD = 8.6 y]), who have multiple-channel cochlear implants received at The Listening Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital, completed the Ontario Health Utilities Index Mark 3 survey and a questionnaire on quality of life changes. Health utility scores before and after cochlear implantation were measured, and audiologic data before implantation and at 6 months and 1 year after implantation were analyzed. Results: Cochlear implantation in older adults is associated with a mean gain in health utility (P < .0001) of 0.24 (SD = 0.33), which corresponds to a favorable cost-utility of $9530 per quality-adjusted lifeyear. Improvements in hearing and emotional health attributes were primarily responsible for this increase in health-related quality of life measure. There was a significant increase in speech perception scores at 6 months after surgery (P < .0001 for both CID sentence and monosyllabic word tests) and a strong correlation between the magnitude of health utility gains and the postoperative increase in speech perception scores (r = 0.45, P < .05).

Methods: These children typically had additional medical and audiological examinations at more than one medical center. The hearing assessments of these children included appropriate behavioral audiometric techniques, objective measures of middle ear function, acoustic reflex studies, transient (TOAE) or distortion product (DPOAE) otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem responses (ABR), and, in some cases, transtympanic electrocochleography (ECoG). After placement of the internal cochlear implant devices (Nucleus CI24), intraoperatively we measured electrode impedances, visually detected electrical stapedius reflexes (VESR) and neural response telemetry (NRT). These intraoperative objective measures were used to help program the speech processor for each child. Postoperatively, each child has had regular Follow-up to assure complete healing of the surgical incision, to assess their general medical conditions, and for speech processor programming. Their hearing and communication skills have been assessed on a regular basis. Postoperatively, we have also repeated electrode impedance measurements, NRT measurements, otoacoustic emissions, and electrical auditory brainstem responses (EABR). We now have 1 year or more follow-up information on the five children. Results: The five children implanted at Mayo Clinic Rochester have not had any postoperative medical or cochlear implant device complications. Ah of the children have shown significant improvements in their sound detection, speech perception abilities and communication skills. Ad of the children have shown evidence of good NRT results. Ad but case D ((who was not tested) showed evidence of good postoperative EABR results. Otoacoustic emissions typically remained in the non-operated ear but, as expected, they are now absent in the operated ear. Conclusion: Our experiences with cochlear implantation for children diagnosed with auditory neuropathy have been very positive. The five children we have implanted have not had any complications postoperatively, and each child has shown improved Listening and communication skills that have enabled each child to take advantage of different communication and educational options.

		"This article provides a review of the topic of treatment efficacy for children with hearing loss. Efficacy is related to a wide range of treatment goals in the areas of sensory and perceptual skill development, language development (regardless of communication modality), speech-production skill development, academic performance, and social-emotional growth. Topics addressed in this article include (a) the definition of hearing loss in children; (b) incidence and prevalence data; (c) the effects of childhood hearing loss on daily life, including language and literacy, speech perception and production, socialization and family dynamics; (d) the role of audiologists and speech-language pathologists in managing children with hearing loss; and (e) a summary of pertinent efficacy research for children with hearing loss. The analysis of the available research suggests that (a) early intervention for children who are deaf or hard of hearing has long-term positive effects on overall development; (b) a variety of communication modalities exist for this population, and research to date has been more descriptive than prognostic on the choice of modality; (c) sensory aids (hearing aids, tactile aids, and cochlear implants) provide different degrees of benefit for children in the areas of speech perception, production, and language development, depending upon the extent of their hearing loss; (d) few studies have addressed rates of learning and long-term outcomes, but existing data suggest that enriched programs provide some children with hearing loss with the ability to overcome developmental lags in language and academic skills."+char(34)+"",

The animals were administered DEX (1, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/ml) or artificial perilymph (AP) via a mini-osmotic pump directly into scala tympani and, on the fourth day after pump implantation, exposed to 120 dB SPL octave band noise, centered at 4 kHz, for 24 h. Animals receiving DEX demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in noise-induced outer hair cell loss (significant at 1, 10 and 100 ng/ml DEX animals compared to AP control animals) and a similar attenuation of the noiseinduced ABR threshold shifts, observed 7 days following exposure (significant at 100 ng/ml DEX animals compared to AP control animals).

		"PROFOUND HEARING-LOSS IN THE CAT FOLLOWING THE SINGLE COADMINISTRATION OF KANAMYCIN AND ETHACRYNIC-ACID",
		"Co-administration of kanamycin (KA) with the loop diuretic ethacrynic acid (EA) has previously been shown to produce a rapid and profound hearing loss in guinea pigs. In the present study we describe a modified technique for developing a profound hearing loss in cats. By monitoring the animal's hearing status during the intravenous infusion of EA the technique minimizes the effects of individual variability to the drug regime. Seven cats received a subcutaneous injection of KA (300 mg/kg) followed by intravenous infusion of EA (1 mg/min). Click-evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded to monitor the animal's hearing during the infusion. When the ABR thresholds rose rapidly to levels in excess of 90 dB SPL the infusion of EA was stopped. This occurred at EA doses of 10-25 mg/kg, indicating considerable individual variability to the deafening procedure. However, there was a strong negative correlation (r = -0.93) between the EA dose and body weight which accounted for much of this variability. Subsequent ABR monitoring showed that this profound hearing loss was both bilateral and permanent. Significantly, blood urea and creatinine levels, monitored for periods of up to three days after the procedure, remained within the normal range. Furthermore, there was no clinical evidence of renal dysfunction as indicated by weight loss or oliguria. Cochlear histopathology, examined after a two months to three year survival period, showed an absence of all inner and outer hair cells in the majority of cochleas. The extent of loss of spiral ganglion cells was dependent on their distance from the round window and the period of survival following the deafening procedure. Clearly, the degeneration of spiral ganglion cells continued for several years following the initial insult. Finally, we observed no evidence of renal histopathology. In conclusion, the co-administration of KA and EA produces a profound hearing loss in cats without evidence of renal impairment. Monitoring the animal's hearing status during the procedure ensures that the dose of EA can be optimised for individual animals. Moreover, it may be possible to adapt this procedure to produce animal models with controlled high frequency hearing losses."+char(34)+"",

		"Normally hearing listeners were presented with vowels, consonants, and sentences for identification through an acoustic simulation of a five-channel cochlear implant with electrodes separated by 4 mm (as in the Ineraid implant). The aim of the experiment was to simulate the effect of depth of electrode insertion on identification accuracy. Insertion depth was simulated by outputing sine waves from each channel of the processor at a frequency determined by the cochlear place of electrodes inserted 22-25 mm into the cochlea. The results indicate that simulated insertion depth had a significant effect on performance. Performance at 22- and 23-mm simulated insertion depths was always poorer than normal, and performance at 25-mm simulated insertion depth was, most generally, the same as normal. It is inferred from these results that, if insertion depth could be unconfounded from other coexisting factors in implant patients, then insertion depth would be found to affect speech identification performance significantly.

The CI-HS students' performance was compared with either a control group of hearing peers (N = 46) or hearing norms provided by the assessment developer.RESULTS: Many of the CI-HS students (47 to 66%) performed within or above the average range for hearing peers on reading tests. When compared with their CI-E performance, good early readers were also good readers in high school. Importantly, the majority of CI-HS students maintained their reading levels over time compared with hearing peers, indicating that the gap in performance was, at the very least, not widening for most students. Written expression and phonological processing tasks posed a great deal of difficulty for the CI-HS students. They were poorer spellers, poorer expository writers, and displayed poorer phonological knowledge than hearing age-mates. Phonological processing skills were a critical predictor of high school literacy skills (reading, spelling, and expository writing), accounting for 39% of variance remaining after controlling for child, family, and implant characteristics.CONCLUSIONS: Many children who receive CIs as preschoolers achieve age-appropriate literacy levels as adolescents. However, significant delays in spelling and written expression are evident compared with hearing peers. For children with CIs, the development of phonological processing skills is not just important for early reading skills, such as decoding, but is critical for later literacy success as well."+char(34)+"",

		"Relationship between perception of spectral ripple and speech recognition in cochlear implant and vocoder listeners",
		"Spectral resolution has been reported to be closely related to vowel and consonant recognition in cochlear implant (CI) listeners. One measure of spectral resolution is spectral modulation threshold (SMT), which is defined as the smallest detectable spectral contrast in the spectral ripple stimulus. SMT may be determined by the activation pattern associated with electrical stimulation. In the present study, broad activation patterns were simulated using a multi-band vocoder to determine if similar impairments in speech understanding scores could be produced in normal-hearing listeners. Tokens were first decomposed into 15 logarithmically spaced bands and then re-synthesized by multiplying the envelope of each band by matched filtered noise. Various amounts of current spread were simulated by adjusting the drop-off of the noise spectrum away from the peak (40-5 dB/octave). The average SMT (0.25 and 0.5 cycles/octave) increased from 6.3 to 22.5 dB, while average vowel identification scores dropped from 86% to 19% and consonant identification scores dropped from 93% to 59%. In each condition, the impairments in speech understanding were generally similar to those found in CI listeners with similar SMTs, suggesting that variability in spread of neural activation largely accounts for the variability, in speech perception of CI listeners.

		"Objectives: To assess a group of consecutively implanted children over 10 years after implantation with regard to implant device use and function, speech perception, and speech intelligibility outcomes; and to document current academic or occupational status.Study Design: A prospective longitudinal study assessing device function, device use, speech perception, speech intelligibility, and academic/occupational status of implanted deaf children.Setting: Pediatric tertiary referral center for cochlear implantation.Methods: The auditory performance and speech intelligibility development of 30 profoundly deaf children were rated before cochlear implantation and at 5 and 10 years after implantation using the Categories of Auditory Performance and the Speech Intelligibility Rating. The academic and/or occupational status of the participants after 10 years of implant experience was documented. All children received a Nucleus multichannel cochlear implant between the ages of 2.5 and 11 years (mean age at implantation, 5.2 yr). Implant experience ranged from 10 to 14 years of use.Results: After 10 years of implant experience, 26 subjects (87%) reported that they always wore their device; 2 subjects (7%), frequently; and I subject (3%), occasionally. Only one child had discontinued use of his device. After 10 years of implant use, 26 (87%) of the children understood a conversation without lip reading and 18 (60%) used the telephone with a familiar speaker. Ten years after implantation, 23 (77%) of the subjects used speech intelligible to an average listener or a listener with little experience of a deaf person's speech. One-third to one-half of the implanted children continued to demonstrate improvements at 5 to 10 years of implant use. Of the 30 implanted children, 8 (26.7%) experienced nine devicefailures. The length of time from identification of the first faulty electrode to reimplant surgery ranged from 2 weeks to 5.5 years, as several failures were gradual or intermittent. However, all children were successfully reimplanted. At the end of the study (10-14 yr after implantation), 19 subjects were in secondary school for children aged 11 to 16 years: 6 were in mainstream schools, 7 were in specialist hearing-impaired units attached to a mainstream secondary school, and 6 were in schools for the deaf. Of the remaining I I subjects, 4 were in college studying vocational subjects, 2 were in a university studying for a bachelor's degree, 3 were working full-time, I was working and going to a university part-time, and I was a full-time mother of two young children.Conclusion: All but I of the 30 implanted children continue using their devices 10 to 14 years after implantation, showing significant progress in speech perception and production. Device failure was frequent, but successful reimplantation occurred in all cases. One-third to onehalf of the implanted children in this study continued to demonstrate improvements at 5 to 10 years of implant use. All children are studying or working and are actively involved in their local communities. The results suggest that cochlear implantation provides long-term communication benefit to profoundly deaf children that does not plateau for some subjects even after reimplantation. This study further indicates that cochlear implant centers need the structure and funding to provide long-term support, counseling, audiologic follow-up, rehabilitation, and device monitoring to implanted children."+char(34)+"",

		"In spite of many satisfactory results, the clinical outcome of cochlear implantation is poorly predictable and Further insight into the fundamentals of electrical nerve stimulation in this complex geometry is necessary. For this purpose we developed a rotationally symmetric volume conductor model of the implanted cochlea, using the Boundary Element Method (BEM). This configuration mimics the cochlear anatomy more closely than previous, unrolled models. The calculated potential distribution in the cochlea due to stimulating electrodes is combined with a multiple non-linear node model of auditory nerve fibres, which we recently developed. The combined model is used to compute excitation profiles of the auditory nerve for a variety of stimulus levels and electrode positions. The model predicts that the excitation threshold, the spatial selectivity and the dynamic range depend on the exact position of the electrode in the scala tympani. These results are in good agreement with recently published electrical ABR data. It is shown that the use of actively modelled nerve fibres is essential to obtain correct predictions for the biphasic stimuli typically used in cochlear implants and that unrolling the cochlear duct as done in previous models leads to erroneous predictions regarding modiolar stimulation."+char(34)+"",

Multiple regression was used to measure the strength of association between these outcomes and variables related to the child (average hearing level, age at onset of hearing impairment, age, gender, number of additional disabilities), the family (parental occupational skill level, ethnicity, and parental hearing status), and cochlear implantation.Results: Questionnaires were returned by the parents of 2858 children, 468 of whom had received a cochlear implant, and by the teachers of 2241 children, 383 of whom had received an implant. Across all domains, reported outcomes were better for children with fewer disabilities in addition to impaired hearing. Across most domains, reported outcomes were better for children who were older, female, with a more favorable average hearing level, with a higher parental occupational skill level, and with an onset of hearing-impairment after 3 years. When these variables were controlled, cochlear implantation was consistently associated with advantages in auditory performance and spoken communication skills, but less consistently associated with advantages in educational achievements and quality of life. Significant associations were found most commonly for children who were younger than 5 years when implanted, and had used implants for more than 4 years. These children, whose mean (preoperative, unaided) average hearing level was 118 dB, were reported to perform at the same level as nonimplanted children with average hearing levels in the range from 80 dB to 104 dB, depending on the outcome measure.Conclusions: When rigorous statistical control is exercised in comparing implanted and nonimplanted children, pediatric cochlear implantation is associated with reported improvements both in spoken communication skills and in some aspects of educational achievements and quality of life, provided that children receive implants before 5 years of age."+char(34)+"",

For implanted children, however, maturational delays for P-1 latency approximated the period of auditory deprivation prior to implantation.

Data from 126 implants were included in the analysis. The mean preoperative low-frequency pure-tone average was 55.4 dB HL. Hearing preservation was observed in 55% of patients. Patients with hearing preservation were found to have significantly higher postoperative speech perception performance in the CI-only condition than those who lost all residual hearing.Conclusion: Conservation of acoustic hearing after conventional length cochlear implantation is unpredictable but remains a realistic goal. The combination of improved technology and refined surgical technique may allow for conservation of some residual hearing in more than 50% of patients.

Neurophysiological data demonstrate deficits in the cerebral cortex of auditory-deprived animals, mainly in reduced cochleotopy and deficits in corticocortical and corticothalamic loops. In addition to current spread in the cochlea, reduced cochleotopy leads to channel interactions after cochlear implantation. Deficits in corticocortical and corticothalamic loops interfere with normal processing of auditory activity in cortical areas. Thus, the deprived auditory cortex cannot mature normally in congenital deafness. This maturation can be achieved using auditory experience through cochlear implants. However, implantation is necessary within the sensitive period of the auditory system.

The overall gain is mainly due to the airbone gap recovery, whereas a further 12-dB mean improvement of air-conducted threshold is evident at 2 kHz. The speech reception threshold in quiet shows a mean gain of 24 dB, whereas in noise, it requires a signal-to-noise ratio 7 to 13 dB greater than normal-hearing controls. All patients are daily users of their VBS device.Conclusion: A middle ear implant capable of directly driving the cochlear fluids seems to be a promising alternative for individuals with a severe to profound mixed hearing loss. However, variability in hearing recovery is great, likely reflecting variability in responsiveness of the cochlea associated with chronic pathologic findings and, possibly, variability in how the VBS effector interfaces with the RW.

Selection criteria, surgical strategies used for hearing preservation, and the benefits of preserved residual lowfrequency hearing, improved word understanding in noise, and music appreciation are described.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The device has been implanted in 48 individuals with residual low-frequency hearing.RESULTS: Hearing preservation has been accomplished in 46/48 subjects. Acoustic speech perception has also been preserved. Combined acoustic plus electric speech processing has enabled most of this group of volunteers to gain improved word understanding as compared to their preoperative hearing with bilateral hearing aids. A subset of subjects with 12 months or more experience demonstrates CNC word understanding continues to improve more than 24 months after implantation. Improved word understanding in noise is also a benefit of acoustic plus electric speech processing.CONCLUSIONS: The improvement of speech in noise and melody recognition is linked to the ability to distinguish fine pitch differences as the result of preserved residual low-frequency acoustic hearing. Both of these measures are very important in real life to the hearing impaired.

		"Objective: To report the patient's characteristics, preoperative audiological profiles, surgical outcomes, and postoperative performance for children with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) who ultimately received cochlear implants (CIs).Design: Prospective, longitudinal study of children with ANSD who received CIs after a stepwise management protocol that included electrophysiologic and medical assessment, documentation of behavioral audiometric thresholds and subsequent fitting of amplification according to Desired Sensation Level targets, auditory-based intervention with careful monitoring of skills development and communication milestones, and finally implantation when progress with the use of acoustic amplification was insufficient.Results: Of 140 children with ANSD, 52 (37%) received CIs in their affected ears (mean duration of use of 41 mos). Many of these children were born prematurely (42%) and impacted by a variety of medical comorbidities. More than one third (38%) had abnormal findings on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and inner ear, and 81% had a greater than severe (>70 dB HL) degree of hearing loss before implantation. Although 50% of the implanted children with ANSD demonstrated open-set speech perception abilities after implantation, nearly 30% of them with >6 months of implant experience were unable to participate in this type of testing because of their young age or developmental delays. No child with cochlear nerve deficiency (CND) in their implanted ear achieved open-set speech perception abilities. In a subgroup of children, good open-set speech perception skills were associated with robust responses elicited on electrical-evoked intracochlear compound action potential testing when this assessment was possible.Conclusions: This report shows that children with ANSD who receive CIs are a heterogeneous group with a wide variety of impairments. Although many of these children may ultimately benefit from implantation, some will not, presumably because of a lack of electrical-induced neural synchronization, the detrimental effects of their other associated conditions, or a combination of factors. When preoperative magnetic resonance imaging reveals central nervous system pathology, this portends a poor prognosis for the development of open-set speech perception, particularly when CND is evident. These results also show that electrical-evoked intracochlear compound action potential testing may help identify those children who will develop good open-set speech perception. Instead of recommending CI for all children with electrophysiologic evidence of ANSD, the stepwise management procedure described herein allows for the identification of children who may benefit from amplification, those who are appropriate candidates for cochlear implantation, and those who, because of bilateral CND, may not be appropriate candidates for either intervention."+char(34)+"",

		"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of cochlear implant (0) insertion depth and surgical technique on intracochlear trauma.STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Twenty-one fresh human temporal bones were implanted with CI electrodes and underwent histologic processing and evaluation. Specimens were grouped into 3 categories: 1) soft implantation technique and standard electrode; 2) soft implantation technique and flexible prototype array; 3) forceful implantations and standard electrode. Based on the grading system (1 to 4), 2 numeric values were calculated indicating the overall severity of cochlear damage (trauma indices).RESULTS: Mean trauma index values were 13.8, 36.3, and 59.2 for group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Differences in cochlear trauma (trauma index) were nonsignificant between specimens in groups I and 2 but were significant between groups 1 and 3.CONCLUSION: This study gives evidence that intracochlear trauma increases with deep insertions. Thus, in cases where cochlear integrity might be important, limited insertions should be achieved. (C) 2006 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.

		"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the disease manifestations and clinical course of patients affected by Cogan syndrome (a syndrome of nonsyphilitic interstitial keratitis and vestibuloauditory symptoms) at a single Institution during roughly a half century.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of all patients diagnosed as having Cogan syndrome at the Mayo Clinic In Rochester, Minn, and who were followed up from 1940 to 2002 were comprehensively reviewed. Otolaryngologic, ophthalmologic, and systemic manifestations of disease were analyzed. Analysis Included patient demographics, presenting manifestations, delayed manifestations, laboratory testing, physical examination features, therapeutic Interventions, disease course, and hearing and vision outcomes.RESULTS: Sixty patients were Identified as having Cogan syndrome, with follow-up from 1940 to 2002. Most patients presented Initially with vestibuloauditory symptoms, most commonly sudden hearing loss (50%). The most common inflammatory ophthalmologic condition noted was bilateral Interstitial keratitis. Headache (40%), fever (27%), and arthralgia (35%) were the most frequently encountered systemic manifestations. Evidence of aortitis was found in 12% of patients. Complete hearing loss was eventually noted In 52% of affected patients, whereas permanent loss of any degree of vision was uncommon. Cochlear Implantation outcomes were uniformly good. Death directly or Indirectly attributed to the effects of Cogan syndrome was noted In 4 patients.CONCLUSIONS: The major disease-related morbidities were due to vestibuloauditory disease and only infrequently due to systemic manifestations such as vasculltls, with or without aortitis. Cochlear Implantation has been of major benefit In modern hearing rehabilitation for this patient population.

		"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term ipsilateral hearing preservation in patients who underwent cochlear implantation for the combined electric acoustic stimulation of the auditory system.METHODS: This was a prospective observational study conducted at a tertiary referral center. Twenty-three subjects were implanted with the MED-EL C40+ standard or C40+ medium electrode using an atraumatic surgical protocol via an anterior-inferior cochleostomy approach. The desired insertion depth was 18-24 mm or 360 degrees. All patients showed significant low-frequency hearing prior to surgery and monosyllabic word scores did not exceed 40% in the best aided condition. Pure-tone audiometry was performed prior to implantation and at distinct intervals after surgery.RESULTS: Nine patients (39.1%) showed complete pure-tone audiometric hearing preservation (0-10 dB) over an average of 29 months. Seven subjects (30.4%) showed partial preservation of residual hearing (hearing loss 15-40 dB) until an average of 25 months. Delayed loss of residual hearing was observed in 5 cases (21.7%) and 2 patients (8.6%) completely lost residual hearing during or immediately after surgery. Freiburger Monosyllabic word understanding scores in a group of patients with complete hearing preservation increased from 13.1% preoperatively to 75% in the electric acoustic stimulation condition.CONCLUSION: This study documents that complete and partial preservation of ipsilateral hearing after cochlear implantation can be achieved in about 70% of cases over an average period of 27.25 months when using 360 degrees electrode insertions.",

Techniques for evaluation of fluoroscopic real time mechanical insertion dynamics, histologic electrode position and trauma results, hydraulic force, and mechanical insertion forces are presented. In addition, this study should serve to present a novel model for cochlear implant electrode insertion evaluations. Study Design. Prospective analysis using a series of analytical techniques.Methods: All studies are conducted in fixed cadaveric temporal bones. Real time fluoroscopic insertion evaluations, histologic evaluations for trauma and electrode position in embedded bones, hydraulic measures, and mechanical intracochlear force measurements are conducted with a current and new electrode.Results. The Contour Advance electrode provides a more reliable and less traumatic insertion when deployed with the Advance Off Stylet technique. This is largely because of a reduction in intracochlear outer wall force generation. Fluoroscopic and histologic analysis reveal a smooth insertion without reliance on cochlear outer wall contact. No hydraulic forces were detected when measured from the superior semicircular canal ampulla.Conclusion: The model used for this study provides valuable information to cochlear implant surgeons and design engineers. The Contour Advance electrode, inserted with the Advance Off Stylet technique,,represents an improvement over the Contour electrode inserted with the standard insertion technique."+char(34)+"",

		"Cochlear implantation at under 12 months: Report on 10 patients",
		"Objectives: There is growing evidence that early application of a cochlear implant in children affected by profound congenital hearing loss is of paramount importance for the development of an adequate auditory performance and language skills. For these reasons and as a result of advances in audiologic diagnosis and an enhanced awareness of the safety of cochlear implants, the age of implantation has substantially decreased over recent years. Children aged as little as 12 months are now being implanted in some centers. On the basis of our experience with very young children, we believe that the date of implantation may be further reduced to only 4 to 6 months of age. Study Design: Over the period from November 1998 to April 2004, 103 children have been fitted with cochlear implants and 11 with auditory brainstem. implants in our department, including 65 children aged below 3 years. The present study focuses on 10 children aged less than 12 months fitted with cochlear implants from November 1998 to December 2003. Methods. The children's ages ranged from 4 to 11 (mean 9.5) months. Five were males and five females. All received a Nucleus CI 24 M. Postoperative auditory performance, as evaluated at the latest follow-up, was based on the category of auditory performance (CAP). The results obtained in these 10 children were compared with those obtained with cochlear implants in children belonging to older age brackets. The criteria used to assess speech performance were onset of babbling onset and babbling spurt, and the results observed were compared with those of a control group of 10 normally hearing children. Results: Surgery was uneventful, and no immediate or delayed complications were encountered. Auditory performance was seen to increase as function of early age of implantation and length of implant use. All 10 children had a CAP score of 3 within 6 months of cochlear implant activation. The onset of babbling occurred very early (i.e., within 1 to 3 months of activation of the implant in all 10 patients), regardless of age at implantation, whereas the babbling spurt was recorded at times ranging from 3 to 5 months after implant activation. The positive impact of early implantation on babbling was clearly shown by the fact that the earlier the activation of the cochlear implant, the closer the results were to the outcomes of normally hearing children. Conclusions: We encourage very early implantation to facilitate a series of developmental processes occurring in the critical period of initial language acquisition. The indices we used in the present study (i.e., CAP and babbling) suggest that early cochlear implantation tends to yield normalization of audio-phonologic parameters, which enables us to consider the performance of children implanted very early as being similar to that of their normally hearing peers."+char(34)+"",

		"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the history of cochlear implant signal processing and provides the rationale underlying current approaches. Present strategies are explained and recent research findings are summarized. It is suggested how these results may drive future advancements in signal processing.RECENT FINDINGS: Substantial advances have been made in our understanding of the spectral and temporal cues necessary for cochlear implant recipients to perceive music, speech in noise, and interaural timing. It is clear that higher levels of both spectral and temporal resolution, as well as better loudness and pitch coding are necessary for higher levels of performance. These factors are highly interrelated, however, and are beneficial for differing aspects of hearing. Signal processing algorithms incorporating these findings are under active development and some are currently undergoing clinical investigation.SUMMARY: Current implant devices, and those soon to be available, have substantial untapped potential to improve the auditory experience of their recipients. It is likely that in the near future, recent findings on pitch and loudness perception, as well as techniques to better emulate the normal functions of the cochlea will result in much higher levels of prosthetic hearing fidelity than are possible today. As the performance of these remarkable devices continues to improve, the population of hearing-impaired individuals who can benefit from implantation is likely to increase significantly."+char(34)+"",

		"Topographic spread of inferior colliculus activation in response to acoustic and intracochlear electric stimulation",
		"The design of contemporary multichannel cochlear implants is predicated on the presumption that they activate multiple independent sectors of the auditory nerve array. The independence of these channels, however, is limited by the spread of activation from each intracochlear electrode across the auditory nerve array. In this study, we evaluated factors that influence intracochlear spread of activation using two types of intracochlear electrodes: (1) a clinical-type device consisting of a linear series of ring contacts positioned along a silicon elastomer carrier, and (2) a pair of visually placed (VP) ball electrodes that could be positioned independently relative to particular intracochlear structures, e.g., the spiral ganglion. Activation spread was estimated by recording multi-neuronal evoked activity along the cochleotopic axis of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC). This activity was recorded using silicon-based single-shank, 16-site recording probes, which were fixed within the ICC at a depth defined by responses to acoustic tones. After deafening, electric stimuli consisting of single biphasic electric pulses were presented with each electrode type in various stimulation configurations (monopolar, bipolar, tripolar) and/or various electrode orientations (radial, off-radial, longitudinal). The results indicate that monopolar (MP) stimulation with either electrode type produced widespread excitation across the ICC. Bipolar (BP) stimulation with banded pairs of electrodes oriented longitudinally produced activation that was somewhat less broad than"+char(34)+"",

		"Can nonlinguistic musical training change the way the brain processes speech? The expanded OPERA hypothesis",
		"A growing body of research suggests that musical training has a beneficial impact on speech processing (e.g., hearing of speech in noise and prosody perception). As this research moves forward two key questions need to be addressed: 1) Can purely instrumental musical training have such effects? 2) If so, how and why would such effects occur? The current paper offers a conceptual framework for understanding such effects based on mechanisms of neural plasticity. The expanded OPERA hypothesis proposes that when music and speech share sensory or cognitive processing mechanisms in the brain, and music places higher demands on these mechanisms than speech does, this sets the stage for musical training to enhance speech processing. When these higher demands are combined with the emotional rewards of music, the frequent repetition that musical training engenders, and the focused attention that it requires, neural plasticity is activated and makes lasting changes in brain structure and function which impact speech processing. Initial data from a new study motivated by the OPERA hypothesis is presented, focusing on the impact of musical training on speech perception in cochlear-implant users. Suggestions for the development of animal models to test OPERA are also presented, to help motivate neurophysiological studies of how auditory training using non-biological sounds can impact the brain's perceptual processing of species-specific vocalizations.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled <Music: A window into the hearing brain>.

		"Time lapse video recordings of cultured adult human and guinea pig spiral ganglion (hSG and gpSG) show that mitogen responsive progenitor/stem cells develop in the form of spheres that proliferate and differentiate into mature neurons and glia cells. Neurospheres, cultured with EGF and bFGF showed expression of nestin and incorporation of 5 '-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU). Newly formed BrdU labelled cells were positive for beta-tubulin, and also for GFAP demonstrating that neuronal cells were derived from a dividing population of progenitor cells. Dissociated spheres cultured either with glia cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), induced differentiation of the progenitor cells. Video microscopy showed that neurons develop from subcultured spheres maintained for up to four weeks. Neurons showed fasciculation and migration with a speed of 10-30 mu m/h, and some cells had up to 6 mm long neurites coexpressing TrkB and TrkC receptors. Precise dissection suggests that the neurons formed are cochlea-specific. The results suggest that the mammalian auditory nerve has the capability for self-renewal and replacement. Transplantation of progenitor cells together with established means to induce neural differentiation and fiber growth may facilitate strategies for better repair and treatment of auditory neuronal damage.

		"Previous work [Nelson, Jin, Carney, and Nelson (2003), J. Acoust. Soc. Am 113, 961-968] suggested that cochlear implant users do not benefit from masking release when listening in modulated noise. The previous findings indicated that implant users experience little to no release from masking when identifying sentences in speech-shaped noise, regardless of the modulation frequency applied to the noise. The lack of masking release occurred for all implant subjects who were using three different devices and speech processing strategies. In the present study, possible causes of this reduced masking release in implant listeners were investigated. Normal-hearing listeners, implant users, and normal-hearing listeners presented with a four-band simulation of a cochlear implant were tested for their understanding of sentences in gated noise (1-32 Hz gate frequencies) when the duty cycle of the noise was varied from 25% to 75%. No systematic effect of noise duty cycle on implant and simulation listeners' performance was noted, indicating that the masking caused by gated noise is not only energetic masking. Masking release significantly increased when the number of spectral channels was increased from 4 to 12 for simulation listeners, suggesting that spectral resolution is important for masking release. Listeners were also tested for their understanding of gated sentences (sentences in quiet interrupted by periods of silence ranging from 1 to 32 Hz as a measure of auditory fusion, or the ability to integrate speech across temporal gaps. Implant and simulation listeners had significant difficulty understanding gated sentences at every gate frequency. When the number of spectral channels was increased for simulation listeners, their ability to understand gated sentences improved significantly. Findings suggest that implant listeners' difficulty understanding speech in modulated conditions is related to at least two (possibly related) factors: degraded spectral information and limitations in auditory fusion across temporal gaps.

All testing was performed with patients using their right, left, or both cochlear implants. Preimplant and intraoperative measures used electrical stimulation at the round window and stimulation through the cochlear implant.Results: Bilateral implantation during the same operation did not cause any postoperative problems such as severe vertigo or ataxia. At 1 year, results of speech testing in quiet demonstrated a binaural advantage for 2 of 10 subjects. Speech-in-noise testing demonstrated that two implants were beneficial for two individuals. All subjects benefited from a head shadow effect when an ear with a better signal-to-noise ratio was available. The ability to localize sound was improved with binaural implants in all subjects. Preimplant psychophysical or physiologic measures were not predictive of eventual speech perception performance.Conclusion: Binaural cochlear implants can assist in the localization of sounds and have the potential in some individuals to improve speech understanding in quiet and in noise."+char(34)+"",

		"This study investigated the relationship between electrode discrimination and speech recognition in 11 postlingually deafened adult cochlear implant subjects who were implanted with the Nucleus/ Cochlear Corporation multichannel device. The discriminability of each electrode included in a subject's clinical map was measured using adaptive and fixed-level discrimination tasks. Considerable variability in electrode discriminability was observed across subjects. Two subjects could discriminate all electrodes, and discrimination performance by the remaining nine subjects varied from near perfect to very poor. Tn these nine subjects, the results obtained from the discrimination tasks were used to create a map that contained only discriminable electrodes, and subjects' performance on speech recognition tasks using this experimental map was measured. Four different speech recognition tests were administered: a nine-choice closed-set medial vowel recognition task, a 14-choice closed-set medial consonant recognition task, the NU6 Monosyllabic Words Test [T. W. Tillman and T. Carhart, Tech. Rep. No. SAM-TR-66-55, USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks Air Force Base, Texas (1966)] scored for both words and phonemes correct, and the Central Institute for the Deaf (CID) Everyday Sentences test [H. Davis and S. R. Silverman, Hearing and Deafness (Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, New York, 1978)]. Seven of the nine subjects tested with the experimental map showed significant improvement on at least one speech recognition measure, even though the experimental map contained fewer electrodes than the original map. Three subjects' scores improved significantly on the CID Everyday Sentences test, three subjects' scores improved significantly on the NU6 Monosyllabic Words test, and five subjects' scores improved significantly on the NU6 Monosyllabic Words test scored for phonemes correct. None of the subjects' scores improved significantly on either the vowel or consonant tests. No significant correlation was observed between electrode discrimination ability and speech recognition scores or between electrode discrimination ability and improvement in speech recognition scores when programmed with the experimental map.

All subjects were bilaterally implanted during adolescence or later. Sound localization was tested in the frontal horizontal plane by using 9 equally spaced loudspeakers and speech-shaped noise bursts at randomized levels.Results: The group of subjects who were bilaterally deafened after 5 to 6 yr of age (18 subjects) showed a statistically significant improvement in sound localization when using both implants, compared with when using only one. The mean deviation between the presentation azimuth and the response azimuth was 16.6degrees when using both implants, which was on average 37.1degrees smaller than when using one implant only. When adjusted for the localization error that was constant across loudspeakers, the mean deviation was 15.9degrees for bilateral implant use, representing an improvement of 30.1degrees over unilateral implant use. Statistical analysis showed that in this group, performance measures were not correlated with subject details such as age at onset of deafness or duration of unilateral implant use. In contrast, subjects who were bilaterally deafened before 6 yr of age (2 subjects) did not show a benefit in sound localization from bilateral implants.Conclusions: Bilateral cochlear implants offer a substantial benefit in sound localization to late-deafened, late-implanted subjects. The very limited data from early-deafened subjects implanted at a later age could suggest that these subjects may not benefit in sound localization from bilateral cochlear implants. It is possible that early implantation for early deafened subjects might allow better acquisition of spatial hearing, thus leading to improved localization performance."+char(34)+"",

		"Perception and production of mandarin tones in prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants",
		"Objective: Mandarin is a lexical tone language in which four tones are crucial for determining lexical meanings. Acquisition of such a tone system may be challenging to prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants because, as recent studies have shown, cochlear implant devices are ineffective in encoding voice pitch information required for tone recognition. This study aimed to investigate Mandarin tone production and perception skills of children with cochlear implants.Design: Thirty prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants, ages 6;0 (yr;mo) to 12;6, participated. These children received their implants at an average age of 5;8, with a range from 2;3 to 10;3. The average length of their cochlear implant experience was 3;7, with a range from 1;7 to 6;5. Tasks of tone production and tone identification involved a pictorial protocol of 48 words containing the targeted tones in either monosyllabic or disyllabic forms.Results: The average scores for tone production was 53.09% (SD = 15.42), and for tone identification was 72.88% (SD = 19.68; chance level = 50%). Significant differences were found in the percentages across the production or identification of tone types or tone pairs. The children with exceptional performance in tone production tended to also perform well in tone identification. The children's performance levels in tone identification and production were also discussed in relation to the factors of age at implantation and length of cochlear implant experience.Conclusions: The present results suggest that the majority of prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants did not master Mandarin tone production. However, a small group of participants demonstrated nearly perfect skills of Mandarin tone production in addition to tone perception. Thus, it is necessary to consider factors other than the device's limitations to explain these high levels of performance in the perception and production of Mandarin lexical tones."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: The study investigated the hypothesis that threshold and comfortable levels recorded from cochlear implant patients would reduce, and dynamic range increase, as distance of the electrode from the modiolar wall (radial distance) decreases. Two groups of cochlear implant patients participated; one group using the Nucleus(R) 24 Contour(TM) electrode array, and one group using the Nucleus standard straight (banded) array. The Nucleus 24 Contour array has been shown in temporal bone studies to lie closer to the modiolus than the banded array. The relationship of electrode impedance and radial distance is also investigated.Design: The study, conducted at three centers, evaluated 21 patients using the Contour array, and 36 patients using the banded array. For each patient, threshold, comfortable levels and dynamic range were measured at four time points. Common ground electrode impedance was recorded clinically from each patient, at time intervals up to 12 wk. An estimate of the radial distance of the electrode from the modiolus was made by analysis of Cochlear view x-rays.Results: Threshold and comfortable levels were significantly lower for the Nucleus 24 Contour array than for the banded array. However, dynamic range measurements did not show the predicted increase. In a majority of subjects, a significant correlation was found between the estimated radial distance of the electrode from the modiolus and the measured threshold and comfortable levels. This trend was not observed for dynamic range. The analysis indicates that other factors than radial distance are involved in the resultant psychophysical levels. Clinical impedance measures (common ground) were found to be significantly higher for the Contour array. However, the electrodes on the Contour array are half-rings, which are approximately only half the geometric size of the full rings as electrodes of the standard array. When the geometric electrode area in the two array designs are normalized, the trends in the electrode impedance behavior are similar.Conclusions: The results support the hypothesis that the relationship between the radial distance of the electrode and the psychophysical measures are influenced by patterns of fibrous tissue growth and individual patient differences, such as etiology and neural survival. Impedance measures for the Nucleus 24 Contour electrode array were higher than the banded electrode array, but this is primarily due to the reduction in electrode surface area. The different outcomes in impedance over time suggest differences in the relative contributions of the components of impedance with the two arrays."+char(34)+"",

		"Coding of the fundamental frequency in continuous interleaved sampling processors for cochlear implants",
		"In this study the perception of the fundamental frequency (F0) of periodic stimuli by cochlear implant users is investigated. A widely used speech processor is the Continuous Interleaved Sampling (CIS) processor, for which the fundamental frequency appears as temporal fluctuations in the envelopes at the output. Three experiments with four users of the LAURA (Registered trade mark of Philips Hearing Implants, now Cochlear Technology Centre Europe) cochlear implant were carried out to examine the influence of the modulation depth of these envelope fluctuations on pitch discrimination. In the first experiment, the subjects were asked to discriminate between two SAM (sinusoidally amplitude modulated) pulse trains on a single electrode channel differing in modulation frequency ( deltaf = 20%). As expected, the results showed a decrease in the performance for smaller modulation depths. Optimal performance was reached for modulation depths between 20% and 99%, depending on subject, electrode channel, and modulation frequency. In the second experiment, the smallest noticeable difference in F0 of synthetic vowels was measured for three algorithms that differed in the obtained modulation depth at the output: the default CIS strategy, the CIS strategy in which the F0 fluctuations in the envelope were removed (FLAT CIS), and a third CIS strategy, which was especially designed to control and increase the depth of these fluctuations (F0 CIS). In general, performance was poorest for the FLAT CIS strategy, where changes in F0 are only apparent as changes of the average amplitude in the channel outputs. This emphasizes the importance of temporal coding of F0 in the speech envelope for pitch perception. No significantly better results were obtained for the F0 CIS strategy compared to the default CIS strategy, although the latter results in envelope modulation depths at which sub-optimal scores were obtained in some cases of the first experiment. This indicates that less modulation is needed if all channels are stimulated with synchronous F0 fluctuations. This hypothesis is confirmed in a third experiment where subjects performed significantly better in a pitch discrimination task with SAM pulse trains, if three channels were stimulated concurrently, as opposed to only one.

		"Congenital malformations of the ear and cochlear implantation in children: review and temporal bone report of common cavity",
		"The objective of this review is to analyze aspects of congenital malformation of the ear in relation to cochlear implantation in children. Having briefly described the in utero development of the ear and the classification of types of external, middle and inner ear malformation, five practical aspects of these malformations are discussed. It seems likely that the combination of bilateral profound sensorineural deafness with bilateral microtia severe enough to make a surgical approach to the cochlea difficult will be extremely uncommon. No such cases have been reported, although Klippel- Feil deformity seems the syndrome most likely to produce this set of circumstances.Abnormalities in the intratympanic course of the facial nerve have been associated with cochlear malformation, emphasizing the benefit of intra-operative facial nerve monitoring, and a technique suggested for safely avoiding an abnormally placed nerve. Fistulae of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and perilymph can complicate surgery and are relatively common in common cavity and Mondini malformations. Strategies for facilitating surgery in the presence of 'gushers', for measuring the pressure of a gusher and for placement of the cochlear implant electrode array are reviewed, with reports of fluctuating levels of electric current when implants lie in dysplastic cochleas.The relationship of implant performance to VIIIth nerve tissue in malformed cochleas is discussed, with a description of the histological findings in a common cavity cochlea. Techniques for identifying the absence of the cochlear nerve are reviewed. Stimulation of the facial nerve by cochlear implants has been described in cases of congenital malformation of the labyrinth but is relatively uncommon. Case reports of the benefit received by implanted children with congenital cochlear malformation have appeared since 1988. Most cases reported have not yet been followed for long enough to establish a clear picture of the outcome following cochlear implantation in such children; no centre has yet built up a large series of cases, but there have been two multicentre postal surveys. It seems likely that in cochlear malformation the range of potential outcomes in terms of hearing threshold and the development of speech perception and production will be similar to the range found in implanted children without cochlear dysplasia. However there is, as yet, no clear picture of the mean level of performance within this range."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: By 24 mo of age, most typically developing infants with normal hearing successfully transition to the production of words that can be understood about 50% of the time. This study compares early phonological development in children with and without hearing loss to gain a clearer understanding of the effects of hearing loss in early-identified children. A secondary goal was to identify measures of early phonetic development that are predictors of later speech production outcomes.Design: The vocalizations and early words of 21 infants with normal hearing and 12 earlyidentified infants with hearing loss were followed longitudinally over a period of 14 mo (from 10 to 24 mo of age). Thirty-minute mother-child interaction samples were video recorded at 6- to 8-wk intervals in a laboratory playroom setting. Vocalizations produced at 16 and 24 mo were categorized according to communicative intent and recognizable words versus other types. Groups were compared on the structural complexity of words produced at 24 mo of age. Parent report measures of vocabulary development were collected from 10 to 30 mo of age, and Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation scores at 36 mo were used in regression analyses.Results: Both groups increased the purposeful use of voice between 16 and 24 mo of age. However, at 24 mo, of age, the toddlers with hearing loss produced significantly fewer words that could be recognized by their mothers. Their samples were dominated by unintelligible communicative attempts at this age. In contrast, the samples from normal hearing children were dominated by words and phrases. At 24 mo of age, toddlers with normal hearing were more advanced than those with hearing loss on seven measures of the structural complexity of words. The children with normal hearing attempted more complex words and productions were more accurate than those of children with hearing loss. At 10 to 16 mo of age, the groups did not differ significantly on parent-report measures of receptive vocabulary. However, the hearing loss group was much slower to develop expressive vocabulary and demonstrated larger individual differences than the normal hearing group. Six children identified as atypical differed from all other children in vowel accuracy and complexity of word attempts. However, both atypical infants and typical infants with hearing loss were significantly less accurate than normal hearing infants in consonant and word production. Early measures of syllable production predicted unique variance in later speech production and vocabulary outcomes.Conclusions: The transition from babble to words in infants with hearing loss appears to be delayed but parallel to that of infants with normal hearing. These delays appear to exert significant influences on expressive vocabulary development. Parents may appreciate knowing that some children with hearing loss may develop early vocabulary at a slower rate than children with normal hearing. Clinicians should monitor landmarks from babble onset through transitions to words. Indicators of atypical development were delayed and/or limited use of syllables with consonants, vowel errors and limited production of recognizable words."+char(34)+"",

		"Is word recognition correlated with the number of surviving spiral ganglion cells and electrode insertion depth in human subjects with cochlear implants?",
		"Objectives/Hypothesis: Speech perception scores using cochlear implants have ranged widely in all published series. The underlying determinants of success in word recognition are incompletely defined. Although it has been assumed that residual spiral ganglion cell population in the deaf ear may play a critical role, published data from temporal bone specimens from patients have not supported this hypothesis. The depth of insertion of a multichannel cochlear implant has also been suggested as a clinical variable that may be correlated with word recognition. In the current study these correlations were evaluated in 15 human subjects. Study Design: Retrospective review of temporal bone histopathology. Methods: Temporal bones were fixed and prepared for histological study by standard techniques. Specimens were then serially sectioned and reconstructed by twodimensional methods. The spiral ganglion cells were counted, and the depth of insertion of the cochlear implant as measured from the round window was determined. Correlation analyses were then performed between the NU6 word scores and spiral ganglion cell counts and the depth of insertion. Results: The segmental and total spiral ganglion cell counts were not significantly correlated (P > .50) with NU6 word scores for the 15 subjects. Statistically significant correlations were not achieved by separate analysis of implant types. Similarly, no significant correlation between the depth of insertion of the electrode array and postoperative NU6 word score was identified for the group. Conclusion: Although it is unlikely that the number of residual spiral ganglion cell counts is irrelevant to the determination of word recognition following cochlear implantation, there are, clearly, other clinical variables not yet identified that play an important role in determining success with cochlear implantation."+char(34)+"",

A series of specific issues is then discussed, including: 1) how to compensate for the loss of cochlear compression; 2) the effective number of independent channels in a normal ear and in cochlear implantees; 3) the importance of independence of responses across neurons; 4) the stochastic nature of normal neural responses; 5) the possible role of across-channel coincidence detection; and 6) potential benefits of binaural implantation.Conclusions: Current cochlear implants do not adequately reproduce several aspects of the neural coding of sound in the normal auditory system.

Children with motor and/or cognitive delays were significantly slower than other children in the development of speech perception skills after implantation. Etiologic factors did not have a statistically significant effect on speech perception outcome.Conclusions: It is likely that central pathologic states account for a substantial part of the variance among children using cochlear implants.

		"Bilateral input protects the cortex from unilaterally-driven reorganization in children who are deaf",
		"Unilateral hearing in childhood restricts input along the bilateral auditory pathways, possibly causing permanent reorganization. In this study we asked: (i) do the auditory pathways develop abnormally in children who are bilaterally deaf and hear with a unilateral cochlear implant? and (ii) can such differences be reversed by restoring input to the deprived ear? We measured multichannel electroencephalography in 34 children using cochlear implants and seven normal hearing peers. Dipole moments of activity became abnormally high in the auditory cortex contralateral to the first implant as unilateral cochlear implant use exceeded 1.5 years. This resulted in increased lateralization of activity to the auditory cortex contralateral to the stimulated ear and a decline in normal contralateral activity in response to stimulation from the newly implanted ear, corresponding to poorer speech perception. These results reflect an abnormal strengthening of pathways from the stimulated ear in consequence to the loss of contralateral activity including inhibitory processes normally involved in bilateral hearing. Although this reorganization occurred within a fairly short period (similar to 1.5 years of unilateral hearing), it was not reversed by long-term (3-4 years) bilateral cochlear implant stimulation. In bilateral listeners, effects of side of stimulation were assessed; children with long periods of unilateral cochlear implant use prior to bilateral implantation showed a reduction in normal dominance of contralateral input in the auditory cortex ipsilateral to the stimulated ear, further confirming an abnormal strengthening of pathways from the stimulated ear. By contrast, cortical activity in children using bilateral cochlear implants after limited or no unilateral cochlear implant exposure normally lateralized to the hemisphere contralateral to side of stimulation and retained normal contralateral dominance of auditory input in both hemispheres. Results demonstrate that the immature human auditory cortex reorganizes, potentially permanently, with unilateral stimulation and that bilateral auditory input provided with limited delay can protect the brain from such changes. These results indicate for the first time that there is a sensitive period for bilateral auditory input in human development with implications for functional hearing."+char(34)+"",

		"Purpose: This study documents child, family and educational characteristics of a large representative sample of 8- to 9-yr-old prelingually deaf children who received a cochlear implant by 5 yr of age. Because pre-existing factors such as the child's gender, family characteristics, additional handicaps, age at onset of deafness and at implant, may affect postimplant outcomes, these variables must be accounted for before the impact of educational factors on performance with an implant can be adequately determined. Classroom variables that may affect postimplant outcomes include placement in public or private, mainstream or special education, oral or total communication environments. Other intervention variables include type and amount of individual therapy, experience of the therapist and parent participation in therapy. Documenting these characteristics for a large representative sample of implanted children can provide clinicians and researchers with insight regarding the types of families who sought early cochlear implantation for their children and the types of educational programs in which they placed their children after implantation. It is important to undertake studies that control for as many of these factors as possible so that the relative benefits of specific educational approaches for helping children to get the most benefit from their cochlear implant can be identified.Method: Over a 4-yr period, 181 children from across the US and Canada, accompanied by a parent, attended a cochlear implant research camp. Parents completed questionnaires in which they reported the child's medical and educational history, characteristics of the family, and their participation in the child's therapy. The parent listed names and addresses of clinicians who had provided individual speech/language therapy to the child and signed permission for these clinicians to complete questionnaires describing this therapy.Results: To the extent that this sample is representative of those families seeking a cochlear implant for their child, especially during the initial period of device availability, this population can be characterized as follows. Most parents had normal hearing, were of majority (white) ethnicity and had more education and higher incomes than the general population. The families tended to be intact with both a mother and a father who involved their hearing-impaired child in family activities on a regular basis. The children were enrolled in the full range of educational placements available across the United States and Canada. Fairly even distributions of children from public and private schools, special education and mainstream classes and oral and total communication methodologies were represented. Educational placement changed as children gained increased experience with a cochlear implant. They received an increased emphasis on speech and auditory skills in their classroom settings and tended to move from private school and special education settings to public school and mainstream programs. These data support the position that early cochlear implantation is a cost effective procedure that allows deaf children to participate in a normal school environment with hearing age mates."+char(34)+"",

		"OBJECTIVE. This review is an update for the US Preventive Services Task Force on universal newborn hearing screening to detect moderate-to-severe permanent, bilateral congenital hearing loss. We focus on 3 key questions: (1) Among infants identified by universal screening who would not be identified by targeted screening, does initiating treatment before 6 months of age improve language and communication outcomes? (2) Compared with targeted screening, does universal screening increase the chance that treatment will be initiated by 6 months of age for infants at average risk or for those at high risk? (3) What are the adverse effects of screening and early treatment?METHODS. Medline and Cochrane databases were searched to identify articles published since the 2002 recommendation. Data from studies that met inclusion criteria were abstracted, and studies were rated for quality with predetermined criteria.RESULTS. A good-quality retrospective study of children with hearing loss indicates that those who had early versus late confirmation and those who had undergone universal newborn screening versus none had better receptive language at 8 years of age but not better expressive language or speech. A good-quality nonrandomized trial of a large birth cohort indicates that infants identified with hearing loss through universal newborn screening have earlier referral, diagnosis, and treatment than those not screened. These findings are corroborated by multiple descriptive studies of ages of referral, diagnosis, and treatment. Usual parental reactions to an initial nonpass on a hearing screen include worry, questioning, and distress that resolve for most parents. Cochlear implants have been associated with higher risks for bacterial meningitis in young children.CONCLUSIONS. Children with hearing loss who had universal newborn hearing screening have better language outcomes at school age than those not screened. Infants identified with hearing loss through universal screening have significantly earlier referral, diagnosis, and treatment than those identified in other ways."+char(34)+"",

Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either the Ineraid cochlear implant, with analog processing, or the Nucleus cochlear implant, with feature-extraction processing. All subjects had postlingual profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and received no significant benefit from hearing aids before implantation. Group data were examined in two ways, First, only subjects who had complete data over the test period were examined. Second, an analysis of all available data was carried out by mixed linear-model analysis. In this analysis, to account for missed fellow-ups at the planned intervals, data consisting of the observations closest in time to the planned test times were modeled by natural splines with knots at the planned follow-up times, Contrasts between all pairs of planned follow-up times for each device were tested, as were contrasts between devices at each planned follow-up time, Results indicated little difference between the performance of the Ineraid and Nucleus subjects in their level of performance or their rate of learning. Postimplantation performance was typically superior to preimplantation performance within 9 months, and continued to improve up to 18-30 months depending on the speech perception measure. In some subjects, improvements in speech perception measures were observed up to four or five years postimplantation. There was also evidence that three subjects had a decrement in overall speech perception performance, although their postimplantation scores were always higher than their preimplantation scores.

		"The effect of parametric variations of cochlear implant processors on speech understanding",
		"This study investigated the effect of five speech processing parameters, currently employed in cochlear implant processors, on speech understanding. Experiment 1 examined speech recognition as a function of stimulation rate in six Med-El/CIS-Link cochlear implant listeners. Results showed that higher stimulation rates (2100 pulses/s) produced a significantly higher performance on word and consonant recognition than lower stimulation rates (<800 pulses/s). The effect of stimulation rate on consonant recognition was highly dependent on the vowel context. The largest benefit was noted for consonants in the /uCu/ and /iCi/ contexts, while the smallest benefit was noted for consonants in the /aCa/ context. This finding suggests that the /aCa/ consonant test, which is widely used today, is not sensitive enough to parametric variations of implant processors. Experiment 2 examined vowel and consonant recognition as a function of pulse width for low-rate (400 and 800 pps) implementations of the CIS strategy. For the 400-pps condition, wider pulse widths (208 mu s/phase) produced significantly higher performance on consonant recognition than shorter pulse widths (40 mu s/phase). Experiments 3-5 examined vowel and consonant recognition as a function of the filter overlap in the analysis filters, shape of the amplitude mapping function, and signal bandwidth. Results showed that the amount of filter overlap (ranging from -20 to -60 dB/oct) and the signal bandwidth (ranging from 6.7 to 9.9 kHz) had no effect on phoneme recognition. The shape of the amplitude mapping functions (ranging from strongly compressive to weakly compressive) had only a minor effect on performance, with the lowest performance obtained for nearly linear mapping functions. Of the five speech processing parameters examined in this study, the pulse rate and the pulse width had the largest (positive) effect on speech recognition. For a fixed pulse width, higher rates (2100 pps) of stimulation provided a significantly better performance on word recognition than lower rates (<800 pps) of stimulation. High performance was also achieved by jointly varying the pulse rate and pulse width. The above results indicate that audiologists can optimize the implant listener's performance either by increasing the pulse rate or by jointly varying the pulse rate and pulse width.

		"Objective: To describe a group of children exhibiting electrophysiologic responses characteristic of auditory neuropathy (AN) who were subsequently identified as having absent or small cochlear nerves (i.e., cochlear nerve deficiency).Design: A retrospective review of the clinical records, audiological testing results, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Fifty-one of 65 children with AN characteristics on auditory brain stem response (ABR) testing had MRI available for review. Nine (18%) of these 51 children with ABR characteristic of AN have been identified as having small (N = 2; 4%) or absent (N = 7; 14%) cochlear nerves on MRI.Results: Of the nine children with cochlear nerve deficiency, five (56%) were affected unilaterally and four (44%) bilaterally. Eight of nine presented after failing a newborn infant hearing screening, whereas one presented at 3 yr of age. On diagnostic ABR testing, all 9 children (9 of 13 affected ears; 69%) had evidence of a cochlear microphonic (CM) and absent neural responses in at least one ear. In the unilateral cases, AN characteristics were detected in all affected ears. In bilateral cases, at least one of the ears in each child demonstrated the AN phenotype, whereas the contralateral ear had no CM identified. Only one ear with cochlear nerve deficiency had present otoacoustic emissions as measured by distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. In children with appropriate available behavioral testing results, all ears without cochlear nerves were identified as having a profound hearing loss. Only 4 (31%) of the 13 ears with cochlear nerve deficiency had a small internal auditory canal on MRI.Conclusions: Children with cochlear nerve deficiency can present with electrophysiologic evidence of AN. These children frequently refer on newborn screening examinations that use ABR-based testing methods. Similar to other causes of AN, diagnostic ABR testing will show a CM with absent neural responses. Given that 9 (18%) of 51 children with available MRI and electrophysiologic characteristics of AN in our program have been identified as having cochlear nerve deficiency makes this a relatively common diagnosis. These findings suggest that MRI is indicated for all children diagnosed with AN. Moreover, electrophysiologic evidence of unilateral AN in association with a profound hearing loss should make the clinician highly suspicious for this problem. Although children with cochlear nerve deficiency who have a small nerve may benefit from cochlear implantation or amplification, these interventions are obviously contraindicated in children with completely absent cochlear nerves."+char(34)+"",

		"Open set speech understanding with cochlear implants, without speechreading, is nowadays a common finding. However, there is a large variation in speech understanding between cochlear implant users. We tried to find pre-operative parameters which predicted the postoperative results. Thirty-seven adult post-lingually deafened Nucleus cochlear implant users with a mean age of 46 years (range 16-68) and a mean duration of deafness of 15 years (range 1.5-47) were studied. Preoperatively, we performed pure-tone audiometry, round window and ear canal electrical stimulation, psychological tests and imaging. Additionally, we measured pre-operatively speech understanding in the auditory, the visual and the audiovisual conditions with several tests which were also administered after 6 and 12 months' implant experience. Correlation analysis between the preoperative variables and the post-operative factors showed that duration of deafness and residual hearing are the most important predictors. The temporal difference limen in pre-operative round window electrical stimulation is a secondary predictor."+char(34)+"",

		"Combined electric and contralateral acoustic hearing: Word and sentence recognition with bimodal hearing",
		"Purpose: The authors assessed whether (a) a full-insertion cochlear implant would. provide a higher level of speech understanding than bilateral low-frequency acoustic hearing (b) contralateral acoustic hearing would add to the speech understanding provided by the implant, and (c) the level of performance achieved with electric stimulation plus contralateral acoustic hearing would be similar to performance reported in the literature for patients with a partial insertion cochlear implant.Method: Monosyllabic word recognition as well as sentence recognition in quiet and at +10 and +5 dB was assessed. Before implantation, scores were obtained in monaural and binaural conditions. Following implantation, scores were obtained in electric-only and electric-pluscontralateral acoustic conditions.Results: Postoperatively, all individuals achieved higher scores in the electric-only test conditions than they did in the best pre-implant test conditions. All individuals benefited from the addition of low-frequency information to the electric hearing.Conclusion: A fullinsertion cochlear implant provides better speech understanding than bilateral, low-frequency residual hearing. The combination of an implant and contralateral acoustic hearing yields comparable performance to that of patients with a partially inserted implant and bilateral, lowfrequency acoustic hearing. These data suggest that a full-insertion cochlear implant is a viable treatment option for patients with low-frequency residual hearing."+char(34)+"",

		"The effect of chronic intrascalar electrical stimulation on the spiral ganglion cell survival of the ototoxically deafened guinea pig was investigated. Immediately after ototoxic drug administration, unilateral sinusoidal (1 kHz) charge-balanced electrical stimulation on a 50% duty cycle was administered for 2 hours per day, 5 days per week, at intensities from 0 (control) to 400-mu-Amp via an implanted scala tympani electrode. The relationship of electrically evoked middle latency response (EMLR) to stimulation protocol and cell survival was studied. At 9 weeks post-drug treatment, the animals were killed and temporal bones were prepared for morphometric analysis of spiral ganglion cell density. The subjects showed essentially complete elimination of outer hair sensory cells, with minimal remaining inner hair cells confined to apical turns. Variable loss of spiral ganglion cell populations was observed, which related to electrical stimulation. In animals that received daily unilaterally electrical stimulation, statistically significant increases in survival of spiral ganglion cells were observed in the stimulated ear, compared to the nonstimulated ear-particularly in basal cochlear regions near the electrode. Spiral ganglion cell density was a function of stimulation current intensity level. Moreover, the slope of the amplitude input/output (I/O) function of the EMLR was found to be dependent on stimulating current level. The effect of stimulation on induced survival may be dependent on a number of mechanisms, including metabolic effects of direct activation of "+char(34)+"deafferented"+char(34)+" spiral ganglion cells.

		"Improvement of Cognitive Function After Cochlear Implantation in Elderly Patients",
		"IMPORTANCE The association between hearing impairment and cognitive decline has been established; however, the effect of cochlear implantation on cognition in profoundly deaf elderly patients is not known.OBJECTIVE To analyze the relationship between cognitive function and hearing restoration with a cochlear implant in elderly patients.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective longitudinal study performed in 10 tertiary referral centers between September 1, 2006, and June 30, 2009. The participants included 94 patients aged 65 to 85 years with profound, postlingual hearing loss who were evaluated before, 6 months after, and 12 months after cochlear implantation.INTERVENTIONS Cochlear implantation and aural rehabilitation program.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Speech perception was measured using disyllabic word recognition tests in quiet and in noise settings. Cognitive function was assessed using a battery of 6 tests evaluating attention, memory, orientation, executive function, mental flexibility, and fluency (Mini-Mental State Examination, 5-word test, clock-drawing test, verbal fluency test, d2 test of attention, and Trail Making test parts A and B). Quality of life and depression were evaluated using the Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire and the Geriatric Depression Scale-4.RESULTS Cochlear implantation led to improvements in speech perception in quiet and in noise (at 6 months: in quiet, 42% score increase [95% CI, 35%-49%; P < .001]; in noise, at signal to noise ratio [SNR] + 15 dB, 44%[95% CI, 36%-52%, P < .001], at SNR + 10 dB, 37% [95% CI 30%-44%; P < .001], and at SNR + 5 dB, 27%[95% CI, 20%-33%; P < .001]), quality of life, and Geriatric Depression Scale-4 scores (76% of patients gave responses indicating no depression at 12 months after implantation vs 59% before implantation; P = .02). Before cochlear implantation, 44% of the patients (40 of 91) had abnormal scores on 2 or 3 of 6 cognition tests. One year after implant, 81% of the subgroup (30 of 37) showed improved global cognitive function (no or 1 abnormal test score). Improved mean scores in all cognitive domains were observed as early as 6 months after cochlear implantation. Cognitive performance remained stable in the remaining 19% of the participants (7 of 37). Among patients with the best cognitive performance before implantation (ie, no or 1 abnormal cognitive test score), 24%(12 of 50) displayed a slight decline in cognitive performance. Multivariate analysis to examine the association between cognitive abilities before implantation and the variability in cochlear implant outcomes demonstrated a significant effect only between long-term memory and speech perception in noise at 12 months (SNR + 15 dB, P = .01; SNR + 10 dB, P < .001; and SNR + 5 dB, P = .02).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Rehabilitation of hearing communication through cochlear implantation in elderly patients results in improvements in speech perception and cognitive abilities and positively influences their social activity and quality of life.

		"The efficacy of cochlear implants is limited by spatial and temporal interactions among channels. This study explores the spatially restricted tripolar electrode configuration and compares it to bipolar and, monopolar stimulation. Measures of threshold and channel interaction were obtained from nine subjects implanted with the Clarion HiFocus-I electrode array. Stimuli were biphasic pulses delivered at 1020 pulses/s. Threshold increased from monopolar to bipolar to tripolar stimulation and was most variable across channels with the tripolar configuration. Channel interaction, quantified by the shift in threshold between single- and two-channel stimulation, occurred for all three configurations but was largest for the monopolar and simultaneous conditions. The threshold shifts with simultaneous tripolar stimulation were slightly smaller than with bipolar and were not as strongly affected by the timing of the two channel stimulation as was monopolar. The subjects' performances on clinical speech tests were correlated with channel-to-channel variability in tripolar threshold, such that greater variability was related to poorer performance. The data suggest that tripolar channels With high thresholds may reveal cochlear regions of low neuron survival or poor electrode placement. (c) 2007 Acoustical Society of America."+char(34)+"",

		"In this investigation we measured the performance of 50 prelingually deaf children on several speech perception tests, Children were from 2 to 15 years of age, and some children were tested with as much as 5 years of cochlear implant use. Speech perception tests included the recognition of stress pattern, consonants, vowels, words, and sentences. The audiovisual perception of consonants was also measured. Average results indicated that gains were being made in the perception of stress and words in a closed-set context within 1 year from implantation. The perception of words in an openset context demonstrated much slower increases over time. Large individual differences were observed. Some preliminary data suggest that children who receive implants before the age of 4 years obtain higher scores, on average, than children who receive implants after the age of 5 years. Some children become part-time users or nonusers of their cochlear implants. The average results from 18 congenitally deaf children were significantly higher than the average results from 12 children with prelingually acquired deafness after 3 years of implant use. Information on vowel and consonant features shows increases in performance after 2 years of cochlear implant use, with the exception of the place feature. For this feature, no changes were observed. Vision-alone testing indicated that lipreading performance increased over time. An audiovisual enhancement provided by the cochlear implant was observed for all features."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: To summarize available peer-reviewed literature to describe the range and rate of complications related to osseointegrated hearing aids in adult and pediatric patients.Methods: We searched PubMed using the terms bone-anchored hearing aid for articles published in English between 2000 and 2011. We included all articles reporting complications rates, except those that were case reports, general review (not systematic review), or commentary, as well as those that did not include patient outcomes, that reported outcomes associated with nonstandard implantation (e. g., 8.5-mm abutment) or were of poor study or reporting quality.Results: After excluding articles that did not meet criteria, 20 articles were identified, comprising 2,134 patients who underwent a total of 2,310 osseoimplants. Complications reported in the literature were typically minor in nature. Skin reactions from Holgers Grade 2 to 4 ranged from 2.4% to 38.1%. Failure of osseointegration ranged from 0% to 18% in adult and mixed populations, and 0% to 14.3% in pediatric populations. The rate of revision surgery ranges from 1.7% to 34.5% in adult and mixed populations and 0.0% to 44.4% in pediatric patients, whereas the total rate of implant loss ranged from 1.6% to 17.4% in adult and mixed populations and from 0.0% to 25% in pediatric patients.Conclusion: Overall, the quality of large scale and/or prospective studies reporting the incidence of complications after osseointegrated hearing aid surgery is poor and lacks uniformity. However, based on available data, which shows a lack of major complications, osseointegrated implantation is a safe procedure in both adult and pediatric populations. Well-designed, prospective studies with uniform reporting standards would allow greater comparison between techniques and more reliable analysis of complications of osseointegration surgery of the temporal bone for cochlear stimulation."+char(34)+"",

		"Fundamental frequency (F0) processing by cochlear implant (CI) listeners was measured using a psychophysical task and a speech intonation recognition task. Listeners' Weber fractions for modulation frequency discrimination were measured using an adaptive, 3-interval, forced-choice paradigm: stimuli were presented through a custom research interface. In the speech intonation recognition task, listeners were asked to indicate whether resynthesized bisyllabic words, when presented in the free field through the listeners' everyday speech processor, were question-like or statement-like. The resynthesized tokens were systematically manipulated to have different initial- F0s to represent male vs. female voices, and different F0 contours (i.e. falling, flat, and rising) Although the CI listeners showed considerable variation in performance on both tasks, significant correlations were observed between the CI listeners' sensitivity to modulation frequency in the psychophysical task and their performance in intonation recognition. Consistent with their greater reliance on temporal cues, the CI listeners' performance in the intonation recognition task was significantly poorer with the higher initial-F0 stimuli than with the lower initial-F0 stimuli. Similar results were obtained with normal hearing listeners attending to noiseband-vocoded CI simulations with reduced spectral resolution. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: The objective of this study was to identify common factors affecting speech perception scores in children with cochlear implants.Design: Speech perception data for 167 implanted children mere collected at two cochlear implant centres in Melbourne and Sydney. The data comprised audition-alone scores on open-set word and sentence tests. Children were selected on the basis that they had a Nucleus 22-electrode cochlear implant. The average age of the children was 5 yr. Information was also collected about 12 factors that may have influenced speech perception scores for each child. Analysis of covariance was used to identify factors that significantly affected speech perception scores. Pearson pairwise correlation coefficients were also calculated for all factors analyzed.Results: The analyses in this study identified factors that accounted for 51%, 34%, and 45% of the variance in phoneme, word and sentence perception scores. Scores decreased by 1.4 to 2.4% per year of profound deafness prior to implantation. Children who normally use oral communication. scored significantly higher than children normally using sign or simultaneous oral and sign communication. Children implanted in Sydney scored higher on average than children implanted in Melbourne.Conclusions: The results show that a significant part of the variation in speech perception scores is systematically related to audiological and environmental factors for each child.

		"Objective: A great amount of variability is observed in speech perception outcomes with cochlear implants. The mechanisms behind the observed variability need to be elucidated. One possible mechanism contributing to the observed variability is the development of cross-modal plasticity. This study examines the association between visual/auditory cross-modal plasticity and speech perception with a cochlear implant in individuals with pre- and postlingual onset of severe to profound hearing loss.Design: The N1 visual evoked potential (VEP) in response to peripheral visual motion stimuli was recorded in individuals with pre- (N = 10) and postlingual (N = 12) onset of severe to profound hearing loss who use a cochlear implant. The association between the amplitude of the N1 VEP response over the right temporal lobe and sentence and word perception scores obtained with the cochlear implant was examined through linear regression analyses. In addition, the association between the duration of auditory deprivation and the amplitude of the N1 VEP response was examined.Results: As the amplitude of the N1 VEP recorded over the right temporal lobe increased, speech perception scores in individuals with prelingual onset of severe to profound hearing loss decreased. However, a clear association between the amplitude of the N1 VEP over the right temporal lobe and speech perception scores was not observed for individuals with postlingual onset of severe to profound hearing loss. Neither group demonstrated an association between the amplitude of the VEP over the right temporal lobe and the duration of auditory deprivation before cochlear implantation.Conclusion: The results suggest that cross-modal plasticity accounts for a significant amount of the variability observed in speech perception performance with a cochlear implant in individuals with prelingual onset of severe to profound hearing loss but not in individuals who acquire severe to profound hearing loss later in life. Furthermore, the results suggest that the influence of cross-modal plasticity on speech perception ability is more greatly influenced by when (pre- or postlingually) a person acquires a severe to profound hearing impairment rather than the duration of auditory deprivation before receipt of a cochlear implant."+char(34)+"",

		"This study investigated the benefits of adding unprocessed low-frequency information to acoustic simulations of cochlear-implant processing in normal-hearing listeners. Implant processing was simulated using an eight-channel noise-excited envelope vocoder, and low-frequency information was added by replacing the lower frequency channels of the processor with a low-pass-filtered version of the original stimulus. Experiment 1 measured sentence-level speech reception as a function of target-to-masker ratio, with either steady-state speech-shaped noise or single-talker maskers. Experiment 2 measured listeners' ability to identify two vowels presented simultaneously, as a function of the F0 difference between the two vowels. In both experiments low-frequency information was added below either 300 or 600 Hz. The introduction of the additional low-frequency information led to substantial and significant improvements in performance in both experiments, with a greater improvement observed for the higher (600 Hz) than for the lower (300 Hz) cutoff frequency. However, performance never equaled performance in the unprocessed conditions. The results confirm other recent demonstrations that added low-frequency information can provide significant benefits in intelligibility, which may at least in part be attributed to improvements in F0 representation.

		"Introduction: The majority of hearing loss in children can be accounted for by genetic causes. Nonsyndromic hearing loss accounts for 80% of genetic hearing loss in children, with mutations in DFNB1/GJB2 being by far the most common cause. Among the second tier genetic causes of hearing loss in children are mutations in the DFNB9/OTOF gene.Methods: In total, 65 recessive non-syndromic hearing loss families were screened by genotyping for association with the DFNB9/OTOF gene. Families with genotypes consistent with linkage or uninformative for linkage to this gene region were further screened for mutations in the 48 known coding exons of otoferlin.Results: Eight OTOF pathological variants were discovered in six families. Of these, Q829X was found in two families. We also noted 23 other coding variant, believed to have no pathology. A previously published missense allele I515T was found in the heterozygous state in an individual who was observed to be temperature sensitive for the auditory neuropathy phenotype.Conclusions: Mutations in OTOF cause both profound hearing loss and a type of hearing loss where otoacoustic emissions are spared called auditory neuropathy."+char(34)+"",

		"The importance of human cochlear anatomy for the results of modiolus-hugging multichannel cochlear implants",
		"Hypothesis: The fact that the anatomy of the basal turn of the human cochlea, especially, is essentially different from that of other species is likely to influence the outcome of cochlear implantation.Background: Multichannel cochlear implants give better speech understanding than single-channel devices. They are intended to make use of the tonotopic organization of the cochlea by selectively stimulating subpopulations of the auditory nerve. At higher stimulus levels and with monopolar stimulation, excitation of nerve fibers from other turns may interfere with this concept, especially with modiolus-hugging electrodes.Methods: A three-dimensional spiraling computer model of the human cochlea, based on histologic data, was used to test the spatial selectivity and the dynamic range before cross-turn stimulation takes place for the Clarion HiFocus implant with and without a positioner. The results were compared with a similar model of the guinea pig cochlea.Results: In humans (in contrast to the guinea pig), a well-designed modiolus-hugging electrode yielded reduced current thresholds and high spatial selectivity without reduction of the useful dynamic range. The apical turn of the human cochlea, however, is largely comparable in this respect with the guinea pig cochlea, where cross-turn stimulation reduces the dynamic range substantially.Conclusion: The clinical success of cochlear implantation in humans and the favorable results with modiolus-hugging devices depend on the anatomy of the human cochlea."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the benefit of having preserved acoustic hearing in the implanted ear for speech recognition in complex listening environments.Design: The present study included a within-subjects, repeated-measures design including 21 English-speaking and 17 Polishspeaking cochlear implant (CI) recipients with preserved acoustic hearing in the implanted ear. The patients were implanted with electrodes that varied in insertion depth from 10 to 31 mm. Mean preoperative low-frequency thresholds (average of 125, 250, and 500 Hz) in the implanted ear were 39.3 and 23.4 dB HL for the English- and Polish-speaking participants, respectively. In one condition, speech perception was assessed in an eight-loudspeaker environment in which the speech signals were presented from one loudspeaker and restaurant noise was presented from all loudspeakers. In another condition, the signals were presented in a simulation of a reverberant environment with a reverberation time of 0.6 sec. The response measures included speech reception thresholds (SRTs) and percent correct sentence understanding for two test conditions: CI plus lowfrequency hearing in the contralateral ear (bimodal condition) and CI plus low-frequency hearing in both ears (best-aided condition). A subset of six English-speaking listeners were also assessed on measures of interaural time difference thresholds for a 250-Hz signal.Results: Small, but significant, improvements in performance (1.7-2.1 dB and 6-10 percentage points) were found for the best-aided condition versus the bimodal condition. Postoperative thresholds in the implanted ear were correlated with the degree of electric and acoustic stimulation (EAS) benefit for speech recognition in diffuse noise. There was no reliable relationship among measures of audiometric threshold in the implanted ear nor elevation in threshold after surgery and improvement in speech understanding in reverberation. There was a significant correlation between interaural time difference threshold at 250 Hz and EAS-related benefit for the adaptive speech reception threshold.Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that (1) preserved low-frequency hearing improves speech understanding for CI recipients, (2) testing in complex listening environments, in which binaural timing cues differ for signal and noise, may best demonstrate the value of having two ears with low-frequency acoustic hearing, and (3) preservation of binaural timing cues, although poorer than observed for individuals with normal hearing, is possible after unilateral cochlear implantation with hearing preservation and is associated with EAS benefit. The results of this study demonstrate significant communicative benefit for hearing preservation in the implanted ear and provide support for the expansion of CI criteria to include individuals with low-frequency thresholds in even the normal to near-normal range."+char(34)+"",

		"Single-sided deafness leads to unilateral aural preference within an early sensitive period",
		"Unilateral deafness has a high incidence in children. In addition to children who are born without hearing in one ear, children with bilateral deafness are frequently equipped only with one cochlear implant, leaving the other ear deaf. The present study investigates the effects of such single-sided deafness during development in the congenitally deaf cat. The investigated animals were either born with unilateral deafness or received a cochlear implant in one ear and were subjected to chronic monaural stimulation. In chronically stimulated animals, implantation ages were at the following three critical developmental points: 'early' during the peak of functional cortical synaptogenesis in deaf animals; 'intermediate' at the age when synaptic activity in the deaf cats dropped to the level of hearing control cats and finally, 'late' at the age when the evoked synaptic activity fell below the level of hearing control cats. After periods of unilateral hearing, local field potentials were recorded from the cortical surface using a microelectrode at similar to 100 recording positions. Stimulation was with cochlear implants at both ears. The measures evaluated were dependent only on the symmetry of aural input: paired differences of onset latencies and paired relations of peak amplitudes of local field potentials. A massive reorganization of aural preference in favour of the hearing ear was found in these measures if the onset of unilateral hearing was early (before or around the peak of functional synaptogenesis). The effect was reduced if onset of unilateral hearing was in the intermediate period, and it disappeared if the onset was late. In early onset of unilateral deafness, the used ear became functionally dominant with respect to local field potential onset latency and amplitude. This explains the inferior outcome of implantations at the second-implanted ear compared with first-implanted ear in children. However, despite a central disadvantage for the deaf ear, it still remained capable of activating the auditory cortex. Appropriate training may thus help to improve the performance at the second-implanted ear. In conclusion, periods of monaural stimulation should be kept as short as possible, and training focused on the deaf ear should be introduced after delayed second implantation in children."+char(34)+"",

		"Delivery of medications to the inner ear has been an area of considerable growth in both the research and clinical realms during the past several decades. Systemic delivery of medication destined for treatment of the inner ear is the foundation on which newer delivery techniques have been developed. Because of systemic side effects, investigators and clinicians have begun developing and using techniques to deliver therapeutic agents locally. Alongside the now commonplace use of intratympanic gentamicin for Meniere's disease and the emerging use of intratympanic steroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss, novel technologies, such as hydrogels and nanoparticles, are being explored. At the horizon of inner ear drug-delivery techniques, intracochlear devices that leverage recent advances in microsystems technology are being developed to apply medications directly into the inner ear. Potential uses for such devices include neurotrophic factor and steroid delivery with cochlear implantation, RNA interference technologies, and stem-cell therapy.

Target speech was presented at the midline (0 degrees), and masking noise, when present, was presented at one of three simulated source locations along the azimuth (-90, 0, and +90 degrees).Results: Benefits of bilateral electrical stimulation were observed under conditions in which the speech and masker were spatially coincident and conditions in which they were spatially separated.

		"Cochlear implants and ex vivo BDNF gene therapy protect spiral ganglion neurons",
		"Spiral ganglion neurons often degenerate in the deaf ear, compromising the function of cochlear implants. Cochlear implant function can be improved by good preservation of the spiral ganglion neurons, which are the target of electrical stimulation by the implant. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has previously been shown to enhance spiral ganglion survival in experimentally deafened ears. Providing enhanced levels of BDNF in human ears may be accomplished by one of several different methods. The goal of these experiments was to test a modified design of the cochlear implant electrode that includes a coating of fibroblast cells transduced by a viral vector with a BDNF gene insert. To accomplish this type of ex vivo gene transfer, we transduced guinea pig fibroblasts with an adenovirus with a BDNF gene cassette insert, and determined that these cells secreted BDNF. We then attached BDNF-secreting cells to the cochlear implant electrode via an agarose gel, and implanted the electrode in the scala tympani. We determined that the BDNF expressing electrodes were able to preserve significantly more spiral ganglion neurons in the basal turns of the cochlea after 48 days of implantation when compared to control electrodes. This protective effect decreased in the higher cochlear turns. The data demonstrate the feasibility of combining cochlear implant therapy with ex vivo gene transfer for enhancing spiral ganglion neuron survival. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

		"INTRODUCTION: Preservation of residual hearing in cochlear implant recipients has been demonstrated to be possible and provides the potential benefit of combined electric and acoustic auditory stimulation. A prototype 16-mm multichannel array has been designed to facilitate placement of 22 electrodes without damage to intracochlear structures. The electrode array is suitable for insertion via the round window membrane (RWM) or a small cochleostomy.AIM: To evaluate the insertion trajectory and the presence of trauma to intracochlear structures with the prototype electrode inserted by either the RWM or a scala tympani cochleostomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen fresh frozen human temporal bones were prepared for cochlear implantation using a standard transmastoid facial recess technique. Twelve electrodes were implanted at the University of Melbourne and 6 at the Medizinische Hochschule Hannover. In Melbourne fluoroscopy was used to monitor the insertions. Twelve prototype electrodes were inserted via the RWM. A further 6 electrodes were inserted via a small scala tympani cochleostomy. The cochleostomy was sited inferior to the RWM to avoid trauma to the basilar membrane and spiral ligament. Specimens were embedded and fixed with acrylic resin and the cochleae then examined histologically at 200-mum intervals using a grinding and polishing technique.RESULTS: Full insertion of the electrode was achieved without significant resistance in all RWM and cochleostomy specimens. In two RWM specimens fold-over of the electrode tip occurred, and in one specimen the electrode penetrated the spiral ligament to lie in an 'endosteal 'position. In one cochleostomy specimen the electrode was rotated within the cochlea to face laterally rather than towards the modiolus. The final electrode position differed for the two groups, with the electrodes inserted via the RWM lying in a more perimodiolar position along the first part of the basal turn. The average depth of insertion was 240 degrees for the RWM electrodes and 255 degrees for the cochleostomy electrodes. Histologic examination showed no damage in any specimen to the modiolus, osseous spiral lamina or basilar membrane.CONCLUSIONS: A prototype hearing preservation electrode array was inserted by either a RWM or a scala tympani cochleostomy without evidence of significant intracochlear trauma."+char(34)+"",

		"Objectives: To compare the auditory abilities and speech performance of children with a profound prelingual bilateral hearing-impairment when subjected to a cochlear implant (CI) before or after 2 years of age. To analyze the complications that arose during, or as a result of, the implantation process in these groups. Design: Prospective cohort single-subject, repeated-measures study of children with profound bilateral hearing impairment subjected to CI. Setting: Tertiary referral center with a program of pediatric CI from 1991. Patients: This study analyzed 130 children subjected to multichannel CI for profound prelingual bilateral hearing-impairment in two age groups: 0 to 2 (n = 36) and 2 to 6 years of age (n = 94). Interventions: The children were evaluated before, and each year after, the intervention (for up to 5 years) with both closed-set and open-set auditory and speech perception tests. Their speech ability was evaluated according to the Peabody Picture Vocabulary and Reynell general oral expression scales. Results: Auditory and speech perception tests improved significantly in all children after CI, regardless of the follow-up time. The infant's performance was better the earlier the implant was performed. Speech tests showed that the development of children treated before 2 years of age was similar to normal children, and no additional complications were observed when compared with CI in older children. Conclusions: When performed before 2 years of age, CI offers a quicker and better improvement of performance without augmenting the complications associated with such an intervention."+char(34)+"",

		"Neuronal cells are unique within the organism. In addition to forming long-distance connections with other nerve cells and non-neuronal targets, they lose the ability to regenerate their neurites and to divide during maturation. Consequently, external violations like trauma or disease frequently lead to their disappearance and replacement by non-neuronal, and thus not properly functioning cells. The advent of microtechnology and construction of artificial implants prompted to create particular devices for specialised regions of the nervous system, in order to compensate for the loss of function.The scope of the present work is to review the current devices in connection with their applicability and functional perspectives. (1) Successful implants like the cochlea implant and peripherally implantable stimulators are discussed. (2) Less developed and not yet applicable devices like retinal or cortical implants are introduced, with particular emphasis given to the reasons for their failure to replace very complex functions like vision. (3) Material research is presented both from the technological aspect and from their biocompatibility as prerequisite of any implantation. (4) Finally: basic studies are presented, which deal with methods of shaping the implants, procedures of testing biocompatibility and modifications of improving the interfaces between a technical device and the biological environment.

Each strategy was a variant of the standard "+char(34)+"HiRes"+char(34)+" processing strategy using 14 channels and 1105 pulses/see/ channel, and a pulse duration of 32 mu sec/phase. Spectral resolution was measured using broadband noise with a sinusoidally rippled spectral envelope with peaks evenly spaced on a logarithmic frequency scale. Speech perception was measured for monosyllables in quiet and in steady-state and fluctuating noises. Subjective comments on music experience and preferences in everyday use were assessed through questionnaires.Results: Thresholds and most comfortable levels with Mono and Vchan were both significantly lower than levels with Tri. Spectral resolution was significantly higher with Tri than with Mono; spectral resolution with Vchan did not differ significantly from the other configurations. Moderate but significant correlations between word recognition and spectral resolution were found in speech in quiet and fluctuating noise. For speech in quiet, word recognition was best with Mono and worst with Vchan; Tri did not significantly differ from the other configurations. Pooled across the noise conditions, word recognition was best with Tri and worst with Vchan (Mono did not significantly differ from the other configurations). These differences were small and insufficient to result in a clear increase in performance across subjects if the result from the best configuration per subject was compared with the result from Mono. Across all subjects, music appreciation and satisfaction in everyday use did not clearly differ between configurations.Conclusions: (1) Although spectral resolution was improved with the tripolar configuration, differences in speech performance were too small in this limited group of subjects to justify clinical introduction.

Speech performance with the experimental processor was measured four times during the first week, and weekly thereafter over the 3-month period. Results showed that the experimental processor produced significantly lower performance on all measures of speech recognition immediately following implementation. Over the 3-month test period, consonant and HINT sentence recognition with the experimental processors gradually approached a performance level comparable to but still significantly below the baseline and postexperiment measures made with the clinically assigned processor.

		"Objectives: Although deaf children with cochlear implants (CIs) are able to develop good language skills, the large variability in outcomes remains a significant concern. The first aim of this study was to evaluate language skills in children with CIs to establish benchmarks. The second aim was to make an estimation of the optimal age at implantation to provide maximal opportunities for the child to achieve good language skills afterward. The third aim was to gain more insight into the causes of variability to set recommendations for optimizing the rehabilitation process of prelingually deaf children with CIs.Design: Receptive and expressive language development of 288 children who received CIs by age five was analyzed in a retrospective multicenter study. Outcome measures were language quotients (LQs) on the Reynell Developmental Language Scales and Schlichting Expressive Language Test at 1, 2, and 3 years after implantation. Independent predictive variables were nine child-related, environmental, and auditory factors. A series of multiple regression analyses determined the amount of variance in expressive and receptive language outcomes attributable to each predictor when controlling for the other variables.Results: Simple linear regressions with age at first fitting and independent samples t tests demonstrated that children implanted before the age of two performed significantly better on all tests than children who were implanted at an older age. The mean LQ was 0.78 with an SD of 0.18. A child with an LQ lower than 0.60 (= 0.78-0.18) within 3 years after implantation was labeled as a weak performer compared with other deaf children implanted before the age of two. Contralateral stimulation with a second CI or a hearing aid and the absence of additional disabilities were related to better language outcomes. The effect of environmental factors, comprising multilingualism, parental involvement, and communication mode increased over time. Three years after implantation, the total multiple regression model accounted for 52% of the variance in receptive language scores and 58% of the variance in expressive language scores.Conclusions: On the basis of language test scores of this large group of children, an LQ of 0.60 or lower was considered a risk criterion for problematic language development compared with other deaf children using CIs. Children attaining LQs below 0.60 should be monitored more closely and perhaps their rehabilitation programs should be reconsidered. Improved language outcomes were related to implantation under the age of two, contralateral stimulation, monolingualism, sufficient involvement of the parents, and oral communication by the parents. The presence of an additional learning disability had a negative influence on language development. Understanding these causes of variation can help clinicians and parents to create the best possible circumstances for children with CIs to acquire language."+char(34)+"",

Consequently, the conclusions that can be derived from these studies are limited and jeopardize comparison between studies.

		"This article presents a critical analysis of empirical studies assessing literacy and other domains of academic achievement among children with cochlear implants. A variety of recent studies have demonstrated benefits to hearing, language, and speech from implants, leading to assumptions that early implantation and longer periods of implant should be associated with higher reading and academic achievement. This review, however, reveals that although there are clear benefits of cochlear implantation to achievement in young deaf children, empirical results have been somewhat variable. Examination of the literature with regard to reading achievement suggests that the lack of consistent findings might be the result of frequent failures to control potentially confounding variables such as age of implantation, language skills prior to implantation, reading ability prior to implantation, and consistency of implant use. Studies of academic achievement beyond reading are relatively rare, and the extent to which performance in such domains is mediated by reading abilities or directly influenced by hearing, language, and speech remains unclear. Considerations of methodological shortcomings in existing research as well as theoretical and practical questions yet to be addressed provide direction for future research."+char(34)+"",

		"Speech perception in individuals with auditory neuropathy",
		"Purpose: Speech perception in participants with auditory neuropathy (AN) was systematically studied to answer the following 2 questions: Does noise present a particular problem for people with AN? Can clear speech and cochlear implants alleviate this problem?Method: The researchers evaluated the advantage in intelligibility of clear speech over conversational speech in 13 participants with AN. Of these participants, 7 had received a cochlear implant. Eight sentencerecognition experiments were conducted to examine the clear speech advantage in 2 listening conditions (quiet and noise) using 4 stimulation modes (monaural acoustic, diotic acoustic, monaural electric, and binaurally combined acoustic and electric stimulation).Results: Participants with AN performed more poorly in speech recognition in noise than did the normal-hearing, cochlearimpaired, and cochlear implant controls. A significant clear speech advantage was observed, ranging from 9 to 23 percentage points in intelligibility for all listening conditions and stimulation modes. Electric stimulation via a cochlear implant produced significantly higher intelligibility than acoustic stimulation in both quiet and in noise. Binaural hearing with either diotic acoustic stimulation or combined acoustic and electric stimulation produced significantly higher intelligibility than monaural stimulation in quiet but not in noise.Conclusions: Participants with AN most likely derive the clear speech advantage from enhanced temporal properties in clear speech and improved neural synchrony with electric stimulation. Although the present result supports cochlear implantation as one treatment choice for people with AN, it suggests that the use of innovative hearing aids may be another viable option to improve speech perception in noise."+char(34)+"",

		"Speech perception in nucleus C124M cochlear implant users with processor settings based on electrically evoked compound action potential thresholds",
		"Adjusting the speech processor of a cochlear implant, per electrode, to the individual's response is a laborious task that may interfere with a user-friendly start of implant-mediated hearing, particularly in children. This research concerns the possibility of processor adjustment based on a profile derived from measurements of the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) thresholds across the electrode array, followed by adjustment of the overall level of the profile to the hearing threshold and maximum comfortable loudness level using live voice. The results for CVC word lists show that speech perception is quite insensitive to the threshold setting of the speech processor. On average, the speech score does not decrease by more than 10% when, with the new method, the threshold setting comes out so much lower that the dynamic range has doubled. In contrast, the speech score appears to be sensitive to an increase of the maximum high-frequency stimulation settings for the basal electrodes, resulting in lower scores at these higher settings. The correlation between the overall ECAP thresholds and conventionally measured subjective thresholds is weak (r = 0.64). However, the correlation between the slopes of these threshold curves is satisfactory (r = 0.82). The correlation between the ECAP thresholds and the maximum stimulation levels is poor, both with respect to overall level and slope (r = 0.39 and 0.36, respectively). Applicability of the ECAP threshold in processor adjustment could not be demonstrated in this study. Prediction of the most critical factor in speech perception, the slope of the maximum stimulation curve, from the ECAP thresholds is poor. However, considering habituation to the initial processor setting of at least 6 months, the small decrease in the CVC scores with the new setting suggests that a more user-friendly adjustment procedure can be developed.

		"Response properties of the refractory auditory nerve fiber",
		"The refractory characteristics of auditory nerve fibers limit their ability to accurately encode temporal information. Therefore, they are relevant to the design of cochlear prostheses. It is also possible that the refractory property could be exploited by prosthetic devices to improve information transfer, as refractoriness may enhance the nerve's stochastic properties. Furthermore, refractory data are needed for the development of accurate computational models of auditory nerve fibers. We applied a two-pulse forward-masking paradigm to a feline model of the human auditory nerve to assess refractory properties of single fibers. Each fiber was driven to refractoriness by a single (masker) current pulse delivered intracochlearly. Properties of firing efficiency, latency, jitter, spike amplitude, and relative spread (a measure of dynamic range and stochasticity) were examined by exciting fibers with a second (probe) pulse and systematically varying the masker-probe interval (MPI). Responses to monophasic cathodic current pulses were analyzed. We estimated the mean absolute refractory period to be about 330 mus and the mean recovery time constant to be about 410 mus. A significant proportion of fibers (13 of 34) responded to the probe pulse with MPIs as short as 500 mus. Spike amplitude decreased with decreasing MPI, a finding relevant to the development of computational nerve-fiber models, interpretation of gross evoked potentials, and models of more central neural processing. A small mean decrement in spike jitter was noted at small MPI values. Some trends (such as spike latency-vs-MPI) varied across fibers, suggesting that sites of excitation varied across fibers. Relative spread was found to increase with decreasing MPI values, providing direct evidence that stochastic properties of fibers are altered under conditions of refractoriness."+char(34)+"",

		"Amplitude mapping and phoneme recognition cochlear implant listeners",
		"Objective: Speech and other environmental sounds must be compressed to accommodate the small electric dynamic range in cochlear implant listeners. The objective of this paper is to study whether and how amplitude compression and dynamic range reduction affect phoneme recognition in quiet and in noise for cochlear implant listeners.Design: Four implant listeners using the Nucleus-22 SPEAK speech processor participated in this study. The amount of compression was varied by manipulating the Q-value in the SPEAK processor. The size of the dynamic range was systematically reduced by increasing the threshold level and decreasing the comfortable level in the processor. Both female- and. male-talker vowel and consonant materials were used to evaluate speech recognition performance in quiet and in noise. Speech-spectrum-shaped noise was mixed with the speech signal and presented continuously to the speech processor through a direct electric connection. Signal to noise ratios were changed over a 30 to 40 dB range, within which phoneme recognition increased from chance to asymptotic performance. Phoneme recognition scores were obtained as the number of active electrodes was reduced from 20 to 10 to 4. For purposes of comparison, phoneme recognition data also were collected in four normal-hearing listeners under comparable laboratory conditions.Results: In both quiet and noise, the amount of amplitude compression did not significantly affect phoneme recognition. The reduction of dynamic range marginally affected phoneme recognition in quiet, but significantly degraded phoneme recognition in noise. Generally, the 20- and 10-electrode processors produced similar performance, whereas the 4-electrode processor produced significantly poorer performance. Compared with normal-hearing listeners, cochlear-implant listeners required higher signal to noise ratios to achieve comparable recognition performance and produced significantly lower recognition scores at the same signal to noise ratios.Conclusions: The amount of amplitude compression does not significantly affect phoneme recognition, whereas reducing dynamic range significantly lowers phoneme recognition, particularly in noise and for vowels. Because the SPEAK processor extracts mostly spectral peaks, the present conclusions may not be applied to other types of processors extracting temporal envelope cues. The present results also suggest that more than four electrodes are required to optimize speech recognition in multiple-talker and noise conditions. A significant performance gap in speech recognition still remains between cochlear implant and normal-hearing listeners at the same signal to noise ratios. Improved cochlear implant designs and fitting procedures are required to narrow and, hopefully, close this performance gap."+char(34)+"",

		"Background. Cochlear implants restore some degree of hearing in patients with severe hearing impairment, but the efficacy of different implants has not been compared. We conducted a prospective trial to compare several cochlear implants.Methods. We studied 82 patients who were randomly assigned to receive one of three cochlear implants: the Ineraid multichannel implant (implant 1), the Nucleus multichannel implant (implant 2), and the 3M/Vienna single-channel implant (implant 3). All the patients had profound deafness, and none had derived benefit from hearing aids. The assigned device was successfully implanted in 80 patients. Twenty-four hearing tests were used to assess the patients' performance before implantation and 12 and 24 months after implantation. The tests were grouped into five categories according to their content, and a weighted composite index was developed to provide a single numerical indicator of the overall auditory response.Results. All the patients were able to hear with their implants. Nineteen of the 30 patients (63 percent) who received implant 2,18 of the 30 patients (60 percent) who received implant 1, and 1 of the 20 patients (5 percent) who received implant 3 were able to distinguish some words and sentences. The scores for the composite index were similar in the patients who received implant 1 and those who received implant 2, and were higher in both these groups than in the patients who received implant 3 (P = 0.02). When 24 patients with implant 2 were given an improved speech processor, their composite index increased significantly within 3 months (P<0.001); their score at that time was also significantly higher (P = 0.04) than the score of the patients with implant 1 at 24 months. Age at implantation, lip-reading ability, and IQ were prognostic indicators of the patients' performance with a cochlear implant.Conclusions. Multichannel cochlear implants are superior to single-channel implants, especially for understanding speech. Changes in speech processing can improve patients' performance."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: This pilot study examined speech recognition, localization, temporal and spectral discrimination, and subjective reports of cochlear implant (CI) recipients with unilateral deafness.Study Design: Three adult male participants with short-term unilateral deafness (<5 yr) participated. All had sudden onset of severe-to-profound hearing loss in 1 ear, which then received a CI, and normal or near normal hearing in the other ear. Speech recognition in quiet and noise, localization, discrimination of temporal and spectral cues, and a subjective questionnaire were obtained over several days. Listening conditions were CI, normal hearing (NH) ear, and bilaterally (CI and NH).Results: All participants had open-set speech recognition and excellent audibility (250- 6,000 Hz) with the CI. Localization improved bilaterally compared with the NH ear alone. Word recognition in noise was significantly better bilaterally than with the NH ear for 2 participants. Sentence recognition in various noise conditions did not show significant bilateral improvement; however, the CI did not hinder performance in noise even when noise was toward the CI side. The addition of the CI improved temporal difference discrimination for 2 participants and spectral difference discrimination for all participants. Participants wore the CI full time, and subjective reports were positive.Conclusion: Overall, the CI recipients with unilateral deafness obtained openset speech recognition, improved localization, improved word recognition in noise, and improved perception of their ability to hear in everyday life.

		"The present study investigated the relative importance of temporal and spectral cues in voice gender discrimination and vowel recognition by normal-hearing subjects listening to an acoustic simulation of cochlear implant speech processing and by cochlear implant users. In the simulation, the number of speech processing channels ranged from 4 to 32, thereby varying the spectral resolution; the cutoff frequencies of the channels' envelope filters ranged from 20 to 320 Hz, thereby manipulating the available temporal cues. For normal-hearing subjects, results showed that both voice gender discrimination and vowel recognition scores improved as the number of spectral channels was increased. When only 4 spectral channels were available, voice gender discrimination significantly improved as the envelope filter cutoff frequency was increased from 20 to 320 Hz. For all spectral conditions, increasing the amount of temporal information had no significant effect on vowel recognition. Both voice gender discrimination and vowel recognition scores were highly variable among implant users. The performance of cochlear implant listeners was similar to that of normalhearing subjects listening to comparable speech processing (4-8 spectral channels). The results suggest that both spectral and temporal cues contribute to voice gender discrimination and that temporal cues are especially important for cochlear implant users to identify the voice gender when there is reduced spectral resolution."+char(34)+"",

		"The limited spectral resolution of cochlear implant systems means that voice pitch perception depends on weak temporal envelope cues. Enhancement of such cues was investigated in implant users and in acoustic simulations. Subjects labeled the pitch movement of processed synthetic diphthongal glides. In standard processing, noise carriers (simulations) or pulse trains (implant users) were modulated by 400 Hz low-pass envelopes. In modified processing, carriers were modulated by two components: (1) Slow-rate (<32 Hz) envelope modulations, conveying dynamic spectral shape changes crucial for speech; (2) a simplified waveform (e.g., a sawtooth) matching the periodicity of the input diphthong. In both normal listeners and implant users performance was better with modified processing, though temporal envelope cues were less effective with higher F0. Factors contributing to the advantage for modified processing may include increased modulation depth and use of a modulation waveform featuring a rapid onset in each period, resulting in a clearer representation of F0 in the neural firing pattern. Eliminating slow-rate spectral dynamics, so that within-channel amplitude changes solely reflected F0, showed that dynamic spectral variation obscured temporal pitch cues. Though significant, advantages for modified processing were small, suggesting that the potential for developing strategies delivering enhanced pitch perception is limited.

		"Congenital CMV infection is a leading cause of childhood disability. Many children born with congenital CMV infection are asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms and therefore are typically not diagnosed. A strategy of newborn CMV screening could allow for early detection and intervention to improve clinical outcomes. Interventions might include antiviral drugs or nonpharmaceutical therapies such as speech-language therapy or cochlear implants. Using published data from developed countries, we analyzed existing evidence of potential benefit that could result from newborn CMV screening. We first estimated the numbers of children with the most important CMV-related disabilities (i.e. hearing loss, cognitive deficit, and vision impairment), including the age at which the disabilities occur. Then, for each of the disabilities, we examined the existing evidence for the effectiveness of various interventions. We concluded that there is good evidence of potential benefit from nonpharmaceutical interventions for children with delayed hearing loss that occurs by 9 months of age. Similarly, we concluded that there is fair evidence of potential benefit from antiviral therapy for children with hearing loss at birth and from nonpharmaceutical interventions for children with delayed hearing loss occurring between 9 and 24 months of age and for children with CMV-related cognitive deficits. We found poor evidence of potential benefit for children with delayed hearing loss occurring after 24 months of age and for children with vision impairment. Overall, we estimated that in the United States, several thousand children with congenital CMV could benefit each year from newborn CMV screening, early detection, and interventions.

Mean aided free field speech discrimination in quiet was 64% at 50 dB, 99% at 65 dB, and 100% at 80 dB.Conclusions: By circumventing the malformed middle ear and directly stimulating the cochlea, the VSB provides a new rehabilitation option for atresia patients.

		"Purpose: Cochlear implantation is an effective technique for restoring hearing in the profoundly deaf. Although cochlear implants are a therapeutical success, huge performance variability in speech comprehension is observed after implantation. The reason for this remains incompletely understood after 20 years of clinical practice and basic research. Which patients are going to respond well and why is an unresolved question. The duration of auditory deprivation plays an important role, and currently is the main predictor of implantation success in children; basically, the earlier the better. However, among patients with identical duration of deafness, performance remains highly variable, suggesting there are other more fundamental factors that determine clinical outcome.Methods: To delineate the cognitive factors that could influence the clinical outcome of cochlear implantation, we correlated resting metabolism PET images acquired before implantation in congenitally deaf children with speech perception behavioural scores measured three years after implantation.Results: Using this paradigm, we showed distinct brain organisation patterns in the deaf brain, which predict good and bad speech perception outcome after cochlear implantation.Conclusion: These data show that brain organisation assessed immediately before cochlear implantation can efficiently predict subsequent speech outcome."+char(34)+"",

Cochlear implants have the potential to accomplish for profoundly deaf children what the electronic hearing aid made possible for hard of hearing children more than 50 years ago. Though the cochlear implant does not allow for hearing of the same quality as that experienced by persons without a hearing loss, it nonetheless has revolutionized the experience of spoken language acquisition for deaf children. However, the variability in performance remains quite high, with limited explanation as to the reasons for good and poor outcomes. Evaluating the success of cochlear implantation requires careful consideration of intervening variables, the characteristics of which are changing with advances in technology and clinical practice.

In contrast, a hearing loss of 30 dB or more usually predicts absent otoacoustic emissions, but normal emissions can be seen in some patients whose behavioral audiograms imply total deafness. Under circumstances that may occur in at least 10% of children with language and hearing problems, ABR and middle ear muscle reflexes can be absent while emission results are normal. This combination seriously affects management guidelines and, therefore, should be part of the screening procedure for every new patient.

		"This study reports epidemiological data for 17 160 children with permanent bilateral hearing impairment >40 dB in the UK in the birth cohorts 1980-95 inclusive. Children were uniquely ascertained from notifications from professionals in health and education. Results indicate a changing aetiological profile over birth cohort. The percentage of unknown aetiologies and those of prenatal or postnatal origin have decreased. while syndromal and perinatal aetiologies have increased. with no change in genetic aetiologies. Nearly 30% of hearing-impaired children have another disability in addition to their hearing impairment. Children with cochlear implants are more likely than other profoundly impaired children to hake a postnatal aetiology and less likely to hake disabilities concerned with learning or cognition. A proxy measure of affluence indicates that significantly more profoundly impaired children in more affluent families receive cochlear implants than do those in less affluent families.

		"Speech dynamic range and its effect on cochlear implant performance",
		"This study examines optimal conversions of speech sounds to audible electric currents in cochlearimplant listeners. The speech dynamic range was measured for 20 consonants and 12 vowels spoken by five female and five male talkers. Even when the maximal root-mean-square (rms) level was normalized for all phoneme tokens, both broadband and narrow-band acoustic analyses showed an approximately 50-dB distribution of speech envelope levels. Phoneme recognition was also obtained in ten CLARION implant users as a function of the input dynamic range from 10 to 80 dB in 10-dB steps. Acoustic amplitudes within a specified input dynamic range were, logarithmically mapped into the 10-20-dB range of electric stimulation typically found in cochlear-implant users. Consistent with acoustic data, the perceptual data showed that a 50-60-dB input dynamic range produced optimal speech recognition in these implant users. The present results indicate that speech dynamic range is much greater than the commonly assumed 30-dB range. A new amplitude mapping strategy, based on envelope distribution differences between consonants and vowels, is proposed to optimize acoustic-to-electric mapping of speech sounds. This new strategy will use a logarithmic map for lowfrequency channels and a more compressive map for high-frequency channels, and may improve overall speech recognition for cochlear-implant users.

Intracochlear voltages were recorded via unstimulated electrodes. The stimuli included trains of identical pulses, with pulse rates ranging from 100 to 4065/s, and a modulated pulse train produced by a single-channel speech processor, with the pulse rate of 824/s.Results: Magnitudes of EPs for each pulse in trains of identical pulses were uniform for pulse rates below about 200/s. For rates between about 400 and 1000/s, an alternating pattern of EP magnitudes was observed, with relatively large EPs following the odd-numbered pulses. For rates between about 1000 and 3000/s, more complex patterns were observed. After the first millisecond of each train at even higher rates, uniform EPs again were observed across pulses, although the absolute magnitude of the EPs was much lower than that observed for low rates of stimulation.

		"To study electric acoustic stimulation, we have developed a model of guinea pig cochlear implantation via a cochleostomy. Thirty minutes prior to implantation, a hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose bead, loaded with either dexamethasone or normal saline, was placed upon the round window membrane. Animals that did not receive beads acted as controls. Pure-tone auditory brainstem response thresholds were estimated before and after electrode insertion, and 1 and 4 weeks later. Selected cochlear histology was performed. Results: Dexamethasone could be detected in the cochlea for 24 h after cochlear implantation. Thresholds were elevated across frequencies in all animals immediately after surgery. These thresholds recovered completely at and below 2 kHz, and partially at higher frequencies by 1 week after implantation. At 32 kHz, but not the lower frequencies, the presence of dexamethasone had a significant protective effect upon hearing, which increased in magnitude over time. The protection was greatest in difficult implantations where an intractable resistance to electrode insertion was met. There was a persistent foreign body reaction at the site of implantation of saline-treated implanted ears but not in the dexamethasone-treated implanted ears. Conclusion: Short-term preoperative delivery of dexamethasone through the round window can protect residual hearing during cochlear implantation, especially during technically difficult surgery.

This affords the opportunity to provide these children access to cochlear implantation, although medical and audiologic challenges must be addressed. The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of cochlear implantation in children who are younger than 1 year.Methods. A prospective study was conducted of 18 children who had confirmed severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss and received cochlear implants at our medical center before 12 months of age. The length of device usage ranged from 6 months to 4 years, 5 months. The main outcomes measured were perioperative and postoperative surgical/medical aspects, the Infant-Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale and age-appropriate phoneme, and word and sentence recognition tests, when appropriate.Results. All children had full insertions of the electrode array without surgical complications and are developing age-appropriate auditory perception and oral language skills.Conclusions.

Assessment of implant function and speech perception.Main Outcome Measures: Device type, time from implantation to revision, cause of failure, performance with original implant versus revision, number of electrodes placed, and surgical challenges related to reimplantation.Results: Forty-five patients initially implanted at this program and 13 patients implanted elsewhere underwent revision surgery. The institutional device failure rate was 3.7% and the overall revision rate was 5.1%. Reasons for implant revision included documented internal device failure (46%), scalp flap complications (17%), optimization of electrode placement (13%), unexplained deterioration of performance (12%), technology upgrade (10%), and intratemporal pathology (3%). Revision surgery typically involved only minor anatomic challenges, but five patients required circumodiolar drillout procedures to improve electrode position. Electrode insertion was equal or deeper in 53 of 58 cases.

		"Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether 1) the SPEAK, ACE or CIS speech coding strategy was associated with significantly better speech recognition for individual subjects implanted with the Nucleus CI24M internal device who used the SPrint(TM) speech processor, and 2) whether a subject's preferred strategy for use in everyday life provided the best speech recognition.Design: Twelve postlinguistically deaf, newly implanted adults participated. Initial preference for the three strategies was obtained with paired-comparison testing on the first day of implant stimulation with seven of eight U.S. subjects. During the first 12 wk, all subjects used each strategy alone for 4 wk to give them experience with the strategy and to identify preferred speech processor program parameters and settings that would be used in subsequent testing. For the next 6 wk, subjects used one strategy at a time for 2-wk intervals in the same order they had for the first 12 wk. At the end of each 2-wk interval, speech recognition testing was conducted with all three strategies. At the end of the 6 wk, all three strategies were placed on each subject's processor, and subjects were asked to compare listening with these three programs in as many situations as possible for the next 2 wk. When they returned, subjects responded to a questionnaire asking about their preferred strategy and responded to two lists of medial consonants using each of the three strategies. The U.S. subjects also responded to two lists of medial vowels with the three strategies.Results: Six of the 12 subjects in the present study had significantly higher CUNY sentence scores with the ACE strategy than with one or both of the other strategies; one of the 12 subjects had a significantly higher score with SPEAK than with ACE. In contrast, only two subjects had significantly higher CNC word and phoneme scores with one or two strategies than with the third strategy. One subject had a significantly higher vowel score with the SPEAK strategy than with the CIS strategy; and no subjects had significantly higher consonant scores with any strategy. Seven of 12 subjects preferred the ACE strategy, three preferred the SPEAK strategy, and two preferred the CIS strategy. Subjects' responses on a questionnaire agreed closely with strategy preference from comparisons made in everyday life. There was a strong relation between the preferred strategy and scores on CUNY sentences but not for the other speech tests. For all subjects, except one, the preferred strategy was the one with the highest CUNY sentence score or was a strategy with a CUNY score not significantly lower than the highest score.Conclusions: Despite differences in research design, there was remarkably close agreement in the pattern of group mean scores for the three strategies for CNC words and CUNY sentences in noise between the present study and the Conversion study (Arndt, Staller, Arcaroli, Hines, & Ebinger, Reference Note 1). In addition, essentially the same percentage of subjects preferred each strategy. For both studies, the strategy with which subjects had the highest score on the CUNY sentences in noise evaluation was strongly related to the preferred strategy; this relation was not strong for CNC words, CNC phonemes, vowels or consonants (Skinner, Arndt, & Staller, 2002). These results must be considered within the following context. For each strategy, programming parameters preferred for use in everyday life were determined before speech recognition was evaluated. In addition, implant recipients had experience listening with all three strategies in many situations in everyday life before choosing a preferred strategy. Finally, 11 of the 12 subjects strongly preferred one of the three strategies. Given the results and research design, it is recommended that clinicians fit each strategy sequentially starting with the ACE strategy so that the preferred programming parameters are determined for each strategy before recipients compare pairs of strategies. The goal is to provide the best opportunity for individuals to hear in everyday life within a clinically acceptable time period (e.g., 6 wk)."+char(34)+"",

Compare the communication outcomes for the early implanted children to those of normally hearing children and children who received a cochlear implant at a comparatively older age.Method: Retrospective review of the communication development of 35 children implanted between 6 and 12 months of age and 85 children implanted between 13 and 24 months of age. Audiologic assessments included unaided and aided audiograms, auditory brainstem response (ABR), auditory steady state response (ASSR), and otoacoustic emissons (OAEs). Formal language, speech production, and speech perception measures were administered, preimplant and at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years postimplant.Results: The children who received their cochlear implant by 12 months of age demonstrated language growth rates equivalent to their normally hearing peers and achieved age appropriate receptive language scores 3 years postimplant. The children who received their cochlear implant between 13 and 24 months demonstrated a significant language delay at 3 years postimplant. Speech production development followed a similar pattern to that of normal-hearing children, although was delayed, for both groups of children. Mean open-set speech perception scores were comparable with previous reports for children and adults who use cochlear implants.Conclusion: Children implanted by 12 months of age demonstrate better language development compared with children who receive their cochlear implant between 13 and 24 months.

		"Implicit sequence learning in deaf children with cochlear implants",
		"Deaf children with cochlear implants (CIs) represent an intriguing opportunity to study neurocognitive plasticity and reorganization when sound is introduced following a period of auditory deprivation early in development. Although it is common to consider deafness as affecting hearing alone, it may be the case that auditory deprivation leads to more global changes in neurocognitive function. In this paper, we investigate implicit sequence learning abilities in deaf children with CIs using a novel task that measured learning through improvement to immediate serial recall for statistically consistent visual sequences. The results demonstrated two key findings. First, the deaf children with CIs showed disturbances in their visual sequence learning abilities relative to the typically developing normal-hearing children. Second, sequence learning was significantly correlated with a standardized measure of language outcome in the CI children. These findings suggest that a period of auditory deprivation has secondary effects related to general sequencing deficits, and that disturbances in sequence learning may at least partially explain why some deaf children still struggle with language following cochlear implantation."+char(34)+"",

		"Current Trends in Treating Hearing Loss in Elderly People: A Review of the Technology and Treatment Options - A Mini-Review",
		"Background: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), by 2025 there will be approximately 1.2 billion people in the world over the age of 60, which marks a shift in world population to a greater proportion of older people. An estimated 70-80% of adults between 65 and 75 years of age suffer from presbycusis, or age-related, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (HL) in the high frequencies. Presbycusis is correlated with decreased quality of life (QoL) and depression and according to WHO, is a leading cause of years lived with disability in the adult years. Objective: The purpose of the current study was to review the body of literature on treatment options and considerations for the elderly population, as there is a variety of audio-technology available today to treat presbycusis. Methods: A PubMed literature search was conducted using the keywords 'presbycusis/presbyacusis/geriatric AND hearing aids/cochlear implants/electric acoustic stimulation/middle ear implants' and 'elderly AND cochlear implants'. References were also mined from papers found. Results: 431 articles were considered in this review of treatment options for elderly patients suffering from presbycusis. Conclusion: Hearing aids and cochlear implants (CIs) are the most commonly used devices for treating mild-severe presbycusis. Reported outcomes with hearing aids indicate they are an effective method for treating mild-moderate HL in cases where the patient is appropriately fitted and is willing, motivated, and able to use the device. Depending on the type and severity of the HL and the specific needs of the patient, electric-acoustic stimulation and active middle ear implants may also be appropriate solutions for treating presbycusis. Finally, very positive QoL and speech perception outcomes have been documented in treating severe-profound presbycusis with CIs. In some studies, QoL outcomes have even exceeded expectations of elderly patients. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel"+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: The principal goal of this study was to investigate the relationships between maternal contributions (e.g., involvement, self-efficacy, linguistic input) and receptive and expressive (oral and sign) language skills in young children with cochlear implants.Design: Relationships between maternal contributions and children's language skills were investigated by using correlation and regression analyses. Thirty-two mothers (mean age = 36.0 yr) and their children (mean age = 4.8 yr) were videotaped during free play and storybook interactions. Mothers' and children's quantitative (MLU, number of wordtypes) and mothers' qualitative (facilitative language techniques) linguistic input were analyzed. Mothers completed a measurement tool specifically designed to quantify their sense of involvement and self-efficacy (Scale of Parental Involvement and Self-Efficacy). The Reynell Developmental Language Scales and data from videotaped transcription analyses were used to evaluate children's oral and sign language skills.Results: Maternal involvement and self-efficacy relating to children's speech-language development were positively related to mothers' quantitative and qualitative linguistic input. After controlling for child's age, mothers' MILU and two facilitative language techniques (recast and open-ended question) were positively related to children's language skills.Conclusions: The performance of young implant users may vary in part because of their mothers' sense of involvement and self-efficacy, as well as the ways in which mothers interact with their children. Given this information, it would be fruitful for professionals working with these families to incorporate goals that enhance caregivers' involvement, self-efficacy, and linguistic input to better support language development in young children after cochlear implantation."+char(34)+"",

		"Cochlear implants: cortical plasticity in congenital deprivation",
		"Congenital auditory deprivation (deafness) leads to a dysfunctional intrinsic cortical microcircuitry. This chapter reviews these deficits with a particular emphasis on layer-specific activity within the primary auditory cortex. Evidence for a delay in activation of supragranular layers and reduction in activity in infragranular layers is discussed. Such deficits indicate the incompetence of the primary auditory cortex to not only properly process thalamic input and generate output within the infragranular layers, but also incorporate top-down modulations from higher order auditory cortex into. the processing within primary auditory cortex. Such deficits are the consequence of a misguided postnatal development. Maturation of primary auditory cortex in deaf animals shows evidence of a developmental delay and further alterations in gross synaptic currents, spread of activation, and morphology of local field potentials recorded at the cortical surface. Additionally, degenerative changes can be observed. When hearing is initiated early in life (e.g., by chronic cochlear-implant stimulation), many of these deficits are counterbalanced. However, plasticity of the auditory cortex decreases with increasing age, so that a sensitive period for plastic adaptation can be demonstrated within the second to sixth months of life in the deaf cat. Potential molecular mechanisms of the existence of sensitive period are discussed. Data from animal research may be compared to electroencephalographic data obtained from cochlear-implanted congenitally deaf children. After cochlear implantation in humans, three phases of plastic adaptation can be observed: a fast one, taking place within the first few weeks after implantation, showing no sensitive period; a slower one, taking place within the first months after implantation (a sensitive period up to 4 years of age); and possibly a third, and the longest one, related to increasing activation of higher order cortical areas."+char(34)+"",

A more significant factor affecting outcomes is the ratio of duration of deafness to age at implantation.Conclusions: Age at implantation carried relatively little predictive value for postoperative performance in subjects 65 years and older. Although a small decrement in mean speech recognition scores was evident, the clinical significance of this difference is questionable when all of the results observed in elderly patients are considered. A shorter percentage of life spent in severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss suggests a foundation of acoustic/auditory processing in the elderly cohort that may mitigate potential physiological effects associated with advanced age.

The noise reduction strategy is based on a 2-channel adaptive filtering strategy using two microphones in a single behind-the-ear hearing aid.Design: Four adult LAURA cochlear implant users (Peeters et al., 1993) took part in the experiments. The tests included identification of monosyllabic CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) words and measurements of the speech reception threshold (SRT) of lists of numbers, in background noise presented at 90 degrees relative to the 0 degrees frontal direction of the speech. Percent correct phoneme scores for the CVC words at signal to noise ratios (SNRs) of -5, 0, and +5 dB in steady speech-weighted noise at 60 dB SPL and SRTs for numbers in speech-weighted steady and nonsteady ICRA noise were both obtained in conditions with and without the noise reduction pre-processing. Physical SNR improvements of the noise reduction system are evaluated as well, as a function of the direction of the noise source.Results: Highly significant improvements in speech understanding, corresponding on average to an SNR improvement of about 10 dB, were observed with this 2-channel adaptive filtering noise reduction strategy using both types of speech-noise test materials. These perceptual evaluations agree with physical evaluations and simulations of this noise reduction strategy.

		"Maturation of the mismatch negativity: Effects of profound deafness and cochlear implant use",
		"The use of cochlear implants to restore auditory sensation in deaf children is increasing, with a trend toward earlier implantation. However, little is known about how auditory deprivation and subsequent cochlear implant use affect the maturing human central auditory system. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the obligatory auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) of implanted children are very different from those of normal-hearing children. Unlike the obligatory potentials, which primarily reflect neural responses to stimulus onset, the mismatch negativity (MMN) provides a neurophysiological measure of auditory short-term memory and discrimination processes. The purpose of this investigation is to review our studies of the effects of auditory deprivation due to profound deafness and cochlear implant use on the maturation of the MMN in children, placed in the context of overall age-related changes in the AEPs. The development and application of a statistical technique to assess the MMN in individuals is also reviewed. Results show that although the morphology of the obligatory AEPs is substantially altered by the absence of a normal N-1 peak, the MMN is robustly present in a group of implanted children who have good spoken language perception through their device. Differences exist in the scalp distribution of the MMN between implanted and normal-hearing children. Specifically, the MMN appears to be more symmetrical in amplitude over both hemispheres, whereas it is initially much larger over the contralateral hemisphere in normal-hearing children. These findings suggest that, compared to N-1, the MMN is a better measure of basic auditory processes necessary for the development of spoken language perception skills in profoundly deaf children and adults who use a cochlear implant.

The cochleas were then histologically processed with the electrode array in situ, and the resulting sections were subsequently assessed fur position of the electrode array as well as insertionrelated intracochlear damage.Results: All perimodiolar electrode arrays were inserted deeper and showed trajectories that were generally closer to the modiolus compared with the standard electrode array. However, although the precurved array designs did not show significant insertion trauma, the method of insertion needed improvement. After insertion of the straight electrode array with positioner, signs of severe insertion trauma in the majority of implanted cochleas were found.Conclusions: Although it was possible to position the electrode arrays close to the modiolus, none of the three perimodiolar designs investigated fulfilled satisfactorily all three criteria of being easy, safe, and atraumatic to implant."+char(34)+"",

		"Cochlear implants have been implanted in over 110,000 deaf adults and children worldwide and provide these patients with important auditory cues necessary for auditory awareness and speech perception via electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve (AN). In 1942, Woolsey and Walzl presented the first report of cortical responses to localised electrical stimulation of different sectors of the AN in normal hearing cats, and established the cochleotopic organization of the projections to primary auditory cortex. Subsequently, individual cortical neurons in normal hearing animals have been shown to have well characterized input-output functions for electrical stimulation and decreasing response latencies with increasing stimulus strength. However, the central auditory system is not immutable, and has a remarkable capacity for plastic change, even into adulthood, as a result of changes in afferent input. This capacity for change is likely to contribute to the ongoing clinical improvements observed in speech perception for cochlear implant users. This review examines the evidence for changes of the response properties of neurons in, and consequently the functional organization of, the central auditory system produced by chronic, behaviourally relevant, electrical stimulation of the AN in profoundly deaf humans and animals.

Thirteen subjects had tumors. 10 NF2 and 3 solitary vestibular schwannoma, and 16 patients had a variety of nontumor (NT) cochlear or cochlear nerve diseases. A retrosigmoid-transmeatal approach was used in T and a retrosigmoid approach in NT patients. The electrode array was inserted into the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle and correct electrode positioning was monitored with the aid of electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABRs).RESULTS: Correct implantation was achieved in all patients. No complications were observed due to implantation surgery or related to ABI activation or long-term use. Auditory sensations were induced in all patients with various numbers of electrodes (from 5 to 15). Different pitch sensations were identifiable with different electrode stimulation. Closed-set word recognition, open-set sentence recognition, and speech tracking scores achieved by the patients are reported in detail. The auditory performance of the patients showed significantly better outcomes than controls (Multicentric European clinical investigations on ABI with NF2).CONCLUSION: We have shown that the indications for the ABI can be extended to include NT patients with severe cochlear and/or cochlear nerve abnormalities. The degree of auditory benefit varies as a function of the underlying pathological conditions, with"+char(34)+"",

The outcomes of the different babbling measures correlated significantly with the age of implantation: the earlier the implantation, the closer the results approached the outcomes of normally hearing infants. The children implanted in their first year of life showed a normal CAP development as early as 3 months after implantation. All Cl children were able to discriminate phoneme pairs of the A E immediately after the fitting of the device.Conclusions: The earlier the implantation took place, the smaller the delay was in comparison with normally hearing children with regard to the onset of prelexical babbling and with regard to auditory performance as measured by CAP."+char(34)+"",

		"Glass-ionomer cements (GICs) originally designed for use as dental materials have a number of advantages over acrylic bone cements. These include lack of exotherm during setting, absence of monomer and improved release of incorporated therapeutic agents; this has resulted in the development of GICs for biomedical applications. Major landmarks in this history are the formulation of defined-composition ionomer glasses and an improved understanding of the biological and material properties of GICs. Following implantation, GICs can form a stable integration with bone, and affect the growth and development of bone, both adjacent to their surface and systemically, through an ion release mechanism. The 'non-inert' nature of this group of materials is also demonstrated by their adverse effects on neural tissue. Successful clinical use of GICs, both as bone cements and as preformed implants for hard tissue replacement, have been reported in the fields of otologic surgery (Cochlear implant fixation, repair of the tympanic chain, eustation tube obliteration and as ear ossicles), and oral and reconstructive surgery. The use of GICs in situations where they will come into contact with nerves or neural tissue is contraindicated. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."+char(34)+"",

		"Importance: Sensorineural hearing loss is the third leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide. Cochlear implants may provide a viable alternative to hearing aids for this type of hearing loss. The Coverage and Analysis Group at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services was interested in an evaluation of recently published literature on this topic. In addition, this metaanalysis is to our knowledge the first to evaluate quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes in adults with cochlear implants.Objective: To evaluate the communication-related outcomes and health-related QOL outcomes after unilateral or bilateral cochlear implantation in adults with sensorineural hearing loss.Data Sources: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and previous reports from January 1, 2004, through May 31, 2012.Study Selection: Published studies of adult patients undergoing unilateral or bilateral procedures with multi-channel cochlear implants and assessments using open-set sentence tests, multisyllable word tests, or QOL measures.Data Extraction: Five researchers extracted information on population characteristics, outcomes of interest, and study design and assessed the studies for risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.Results: A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most unilateral implant studies showed a statistically significant improvement in mean speech scores as measured by open-set sentence or multisyllable word tests; meta-analysis revealed a significant improvement in QOL after unilateral implantation. Results from studies assessing bilateral implantation showed improvement in communication-related outcomes compared with unilateral implantation and additional improvements in sound localization compared with unilateral device use or implantation only. Based on a few studies, the QOL outcomes varied across tests after bilateral implantation.Conclusions and Relevance: Unilateral cochlear implants provide improved hearing and significantly improve QOL, and improvements in sound localization are noted for bilateral implantation.

		"Objectives: The purpose of this investigation was to compare speech recognition and localization performance of subjects who wear bilateral cochlear implants (CICI) with subjects who wear a unilateral cochlear implant (true CI-omly).Design: A total of 73 subjects participated in this study. Specifically, of the 73 subjects, 64 (32 CICI and 32 true CI-omly) participated in the word recognition testing; 66 (33 CICI and 33 true CI-only) participated in the sentence recognition testing; and 24 (12 CICI and 12 true CI-omly) participated in the localization testing. Because of time constraints not all subjects completed all testing. The average age at implantation for the CICI and true CI-omly listeners who participated in the speech perception testing was 54 and 55 yrs, respectively, and the average duration of deafness was 8 yrs for both groups of listeners. The average age at implantation for the CICI and true CI-omly listeners who participated in the localization testing was 54 and 53 yrs, respectively, and the average duration of deafness was 10 yrs for the CICI listeners and 11 yrs for the true CI-omly listeners. All speech stimuli were presented from the front. The test setup for everyday-sound localization comprised an eight-speaker array spanning, an arc of approximately 108 degrees in the frontal horizontal plane.Results: Average group results were transformed to Rationalized Arcsine Unit scores. A comparison in performance between the CICI score and the true CI-only score in quiet revealed a significant difference between the two groups with the CICI group scoring 19% higher for sentences and 24% higher for words. In addition, when both cochlear implants were used together (CICI) rather than when either cochlear implant was used alone (right CI or left CI) for the CICI listeners, results indicated a significant binaural summation effect for sentences and words.Conclusion: The average group results in this study showed significantly greater benefit on words and sentences in quiet and localization for listeners using two cochlear implants over those using only one cochlear implant. One explanation of this result might be that the same information from both sides are combined, which results in a better representation of the stimulus. A second explanation might be that CICI allow for the transfer of different neural information from two damaged peripheral auditory systems leading to different patterns of information summating centrally resulting in enhanced speech perception. A future study using similar methodology to the current one will have to be conducted to determine if listeners with two cochlear implants are able to perform better than listeners with one cochlear implant in noise."+char(34)+"",

		"The level of hearing rehabilitation enjoyed by cochlear implant (CI) recipients has increased dramatically since the introduction of these devices. This improvement is the result of continual development of these systems and the inclusion of subjects with less severe auditory pathology. Developments include advanced signal processing, higher stimulation rates, greater numbers of channels, and more efficient electrode arrays that are less likely to produce insertion damage. New directions in the application of CIs, particularly in combined acoustic and electrical stimulation, and increasing performance expectations will place greater demands on future electrode arrays. Specifically, the next generation of arrays must be reliably inserted without damage, must maintain residual acoustic function, and may need to be inserted more deeply. In this study, we measured the mechanical properties of eight clinical and prototype human CI electrode arrays and evaluated insertion trauma and insertion depth in 79 implanted cadaver temporal bones. We found that the size and shape of the array directly affect the incidence of observed trauma. Further, arrays with greater stiffness in the plane perpendicular to the plane of the cochlear spiral are less likely to cause severe trauma than arrays with similar vertical and horizontal stiffness."+char(34)+"",

The mean scores were 72% for the Phonetically Balanced Kindergarten word test, 44% for word recognition in noise, 55.3 words per minute for the CDT, and 33 words per minute for the CDT via telephone. Thirty-three children (40%) developed speech intelligible to the average listener (SIR 5), and 22 (27%) developed speech intelligible to a listener with little experience of deaf person's speech (SIR 4). The measures of vocabulary showed that most (76%) of children who received implants scored below the median value of their normally hearing peers. The age at implantation was the most important factor that may influence the postimplant outcomes. Regarding educational/vocational status, 6 subjects attend universities, 3 already have a professional activity, 14 are currently at high school level, 32 are at junior high school level, 6 additional children are enrolled in a special unit for children with disability, and 3 children are still attending elementary schools. Seventeen are in further noncompulsory education studying a range of subjects at vocational level.Conclusion: This long-term report shows that many profoundly hearing-impaired children using cochlear implants can develop functional levels of speech perception and production, attain age-appropriate oral language, develop competency level in a language other than their primary language, and achieve satisfactory academic performance."+char(34)+"",

		"Changes in pitch with a cochlear implant over time",
		"In the normal auditory system, the perceived pitch of a tone is closely linked to the cochlear place of vibration. It has generally been assumed that highrate electrical stimulation by a cochlear implant electrode also evokes a pitch sensation corresponding to the electrode's cochlear place ("+char(34)+"place"+char(34)+" code) and stimulation rate ("+char(34)+"temporal"+char(34)+" code). However, other factors may affect electric pitch sensation, such as a substantial loss of nearby nerve fibers or even higher-level perceptual changes due to experience. The goals of this study were to measure electric pitch sensations in hybrid shortelectrode) cochlear implant patients and to examine which factors might contribute to the perceived pitch. To look at, effects of experience, electric pitch sensations were compared with acoustic tone references presented to the non-implanted ear at various stages of implant Use, ranging from hookup to 5 years. Here, we show that electric pitch perception often shifts in frequency, sometimes by as much as two octaves, during the first few years of implant use. Additional pitch measurements in more recently implanted patients at shorter time intervals LIP to I year of implant rise suggest two likely contributions to these observed pitch shifts: intersession variability (tip to one octave) and slow, systematic changes over time. We also Found that the early pitch sensations for a constant electrode location can vary greatly across subjects and that these variations are strongly correlated with speech reception performance. Specifically, patients with an early low-pitch sensation tend to perform poorly with the implant compared to those with an early high-pitch sensation, which may be linked to less nerve survival in the basal end of the cochlea in the low-pitch patients. In contrast, late pitch sensations show no correlation with speech Perception. These results together suggest that earl), pitch sensations may more closely reflect peripheral innervation patterns, while later pitch sensations may reflect higher-level, experience-dependent changes. These pitch shifts over time not only raise questions for strict place-based theories of pitch perception, but also imply that experience may have a greater influence on cochlear implant perception than previously thought."+char(34)+"",

		"Electrical suppression of tinnitus with high-rate pulse trains",
		"Hypothesis: Application of high-rate pulse trains (e.g., 4800 pps) to the cochlea may represent an effective treatment of tinnitus.Background: Tinnitus is a widespread clinical problem with multiple treatments but no cure. A cure for tinnitus would restore the perception of silence. One plausible hypothesis for the origin of tinnitus associated with sensorineural hearing loss is that it is due to loss or alteration of the normal spontaneous activity in the deafferented regions of the cochlea. Electrical stimulation of the cochlea with 5000-pps pulse trains can produce spontaneous-like patterns of spike activity in the auditory nerve.Methods: Eleven volunteer human subjects with bothersome tinnitus and high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss underwent myringotomy and temporary placement of a round window electrode. High-rate pulse train stimuli were presented at various stimulus intensities and tinnitus, and stimulus perception were scaled by the subject. Three cochlear implant recipients with tinnitus in the implanted ear underwent similar stimulation.Results: Five of 11 (45%) of transtympanic subjects showed substantial or complete tinnitus suppression with either no perception or only a transient perception of the stimulus. Three showed tinnitus suppression only in association with the perception of the stimulus. Three showed no effects on tinnitus. A similar pattern of responses was seen in the cochlear implant subjects.Conclusions: Although the study lacked an ideal placebo control, the results are promising and support further research to develop a clinically useful intervention for this troubling disorder."+char(34)+"",

All subjects involved in the trial had bilateral acoustic tumour as a result of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) resulting in complete dysfunction of the VIIIth nerve. The study used each subject as their own control without a preoperative baseline because residual hearing, if existing, was destroyed at surgery by tumour removal. A battery of speech tests was conducted to evaluate each patient's performance and communication abilities. Tests were conducted, where possible, in the auditory-only, visual-only, and auditory-visual conditions at 3 days postoperatively (baseline), at 3-mo intervals for the first year and every 12 mo thereafter. A subjective performance questionnaire was administered together with an extensive neurological examination at each test interval.Results: 27 subjects involved in this trial were successfully implanted with a Nucleus ABI. One subject died 2 days postoperatively due to a lung embolism unrelated to the device. Twenty-six subjects underwent device activation and all but one patient received auditory sensation at initial stimulation (96.2%). On average 8.6 (+/-4.2) of the available 21 electrodes were used in the patients' MAPs. Performance evaluation measures showed that the majority of users had access to auditory information such as environmental sound awareness together with stress and rhythm cues in speech that assist with lipreading. Although most subjects did not achieve any functional auditory-alone, open-set speech understanding, two subjects from this series (7.4%) did receive sufficient benefit to be able to use the ABI in conversation without lipreading.Conclusions: Although the medical risks and surgical complexity associated with ABI device implantation are far greater than those for a cochlear implant, the clinical results from this trial show that the Nucleus multichannel ABI is capable of providing a significant patient benefit over risk ratio for subjects suffering loss of hearing due to bilateral retrocochlear lesions."+char(34)+"",

L-1-L- 2 was level dependent in order to produce the largest 2 f(1)-f(2) responses in normal ears. System distortion was determined by collecting DP data in six different acoustic cavities. These data were used to derive a multiple linear regression model to predict system distortion levels. The model was tested on cochlear-implant users and used to estimate system distortion in all other ears. At most but not all f(2)'s, measurements in cochlear implant ears were consistent with model predictions. At all f(2) frequencies, the ears with normal auditory thresholds produced I/O functions characterized by compressive nonlinear regions at moderate levels, with more rapid growth at low and high stimulus levels. As auditory threshold increased, DPOAE threshold increased, accompanied by DPOAE amplitude reductions, notably over the range of levels where normal ears showed compression. The slope of the I/O function was steeper in impaired ears. The data from normal-hearing ears resembled direct measurements of basilar membrane displacement in lower animals. Data from ears with hearing loss showed that the compressive region was affected by cochlear damage; however, responses at high levels of stimulation resembled those observed in normal ears.

		"Objectives: Deaf children with cochlear implants are at a disadvantage in learning vocabulary when compared with hearing peers. Past research has reported that children with implants have lower receptive vocabulary scores and less growth over time than hearing children. Research findings are mixed as to the effects of age at implantation on vocabulary skills and development. One goal of the current study is to determine how children with cochlear implants educated in an auditory-oral environment compared with their hearing peers on a receptive vocabulary measure in overall achievement and growth rates. This study will also investigate the effects of age at implant on vocabulary abilities and growth rates. We expect that the children with implants will have smaller vocabularies than their hearing peers but will achieve similar rates of growth as their implant experience increases. We also expect that children who receive their implants at young ages will have better overall vocabulary and higher growth rates than older-at-implant children.Design: Repeated assessments using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test were given to 65 deaf children with cochlear implants who used oral communication, who were implanted under the age of 5 yr, and who attended an intensive auditory-oral education program. Multilevel modeling was used to describe overall abilities and rates of receptive vocabulary growth over time.Results: On average, the deaf children with cochlear implants had lower vocabulary scores than their hearing peers. However, the deaf children demonstrated substantial vocabulary growth, making more than 1 yr's worth of progress in a year. This finding contrasts with those of previous studies of children with implants, which found lower growth rates. A negative quadratic trend indicated that growth decelerated with time. Age at implantation significantly affected linear and quadratic growth. Younger-at-implant children had steeper growth rates but more tapering off with time than children implanted later in life.Conclusions: Growth curves indicate that children who are implanted by the age of 2 yr can achieve receptive vocabulary skills within the average range for hearing children."+char(34)+"",

		"The development of cochlear implantation has allowed the majority of patients deafened after the development of language to regain significant auditory benefit. In a subset of patients, however, loss of hearing results from destruction of the cochlear nerves, rendering cochlear implantation ineffective. The most common cause of bilateral destruction of the cochlear nerves is neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The hallmark of this genetic disorder is the development of bilateral acoustic neuromas, the growth or removal of which causes deafness in most patients. Patients with NF2 may benefit from direct stimulation of the cochlear nucleus. We describe the development, use, and results of the auditory brainstem implant (ABI), which is typically implanted via craniotomy at the time of tumor removal. Most patients with the implant have good appreciation of environmental sounds, but obtain more modest benefit with regard to speech perception.

		"Increasing numbers of cochlear implant subjects have some level of residual hearing at the time of implantation. The present study examined whether (i) hair cells that have survived one pathological insult (aminoglycoside deafening), can survive and function following long-term cochlear implantation and electrical stimulation (ES); and (ii) chronic ES in these cochleae results in greater trophic support of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) compared with cochleae devoid of hair cells. Eight cats, with either partial (n = 4) or severe (n = 4) sensorineural hearing loss, were bilaterally implanted with scala tympani electrode arrays 2 months after deafening, and received unilateral ES using charge balanced biphasic current pulses for periods of up to 235 days. Frequency-specific compound action potentials and click-evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded periodically to monitor the residual acoustic hearing. Electrically evoked ABRs (EABRs) were recorded to confirm the stimulus levels were 3-6 dB above the EABR threshold. On completion of the ES program the cochleae were examined histologically. Partially deafened animals showed no significant increase in acoustic thresholds over the implantation period. Moreover, chronic ES of an electrode array located in the base of the cochlea did not adversely affect hair cells in the middle or apical turns. There was evidence of a small but statistically significant rescue of SGNs in the middle and apical turns of stimulated cochleae in animals with partial hearing. Chronic ES did not, however, prevent a reduction in SGN density for the severely deaf cohort, although SGNs adjacent to the stimulating electrodes did exhibit a significant increase in soma area (P < 0.01). In sum, chronic ES in partial hearing animals does not adversely affect functioning residual hair cells apical to the electrode array. Moreover, while there is an increase in the soma area of SGNs close to the stimulating electrodes in severely deaf cochleae, this trophic effect does not result in increased SGN survival.

		"Objective/Hypothesis: To assess the audiologic and surgical outcomes for pediatric cochlear implant patients with inner ear malformations. Study Design: Retrospective review of 315 pediatric cochlear implant cases from 1994 to 2002. Methods: Twenty-eight pediatric cochlear implant patients with known inner ear malformations determined on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the temporal bone were the subjects of review. Results of HRCT findings, intraoperative findings, postoperative complications, and objective measures of both closed- and open-set testing of speech perception were analyzed. Results: Patients with the constellation of an incompletely partitioned (IP) cochlea, enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA), and a dilated vestibule (i.e., Mondini's malformation) as well as those with an isolated EVA or partial semicircular canal aplasia have relatively good levels of speech perception. Patients with total semicircular canal aplasia, isolated IP, cochlear hypoplasia, or common cavity demonstrated lower levels of performance. Poor performance may be related to associated developmental delays rather than labyrinthine anatomy alone. Complications of surgery were relatively limited. Conclusions: Cochlear implantation can be successfully performed in children with inner ear malformations. These children and their parents can expect significant auditory benefits from this intervention. The various types of inner ear malformations may have quite different prognoses for good auditory performance."+char(34)+"",

		"Hair cell loss, the most common cause of deafness, is often associated with auditory nerve degeneration. Our goal was to determine the influence of combined ciliary-derived neurotrophic factor ( CNTF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) gene therapy on the survival of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) after elimination of inner hair cells in the mature guinea pig ear. Seven days after bilateral deafening, a 5-l suspension of CNTF and/ or BDNF adenovirus vectors was injected into the left scala tympani through the round window. Animals were sacrificed 28 days after deafening, and their inner ears were prepared for SGN counts. The SGN counts revealed that BDNF alone and the combined CNTF and BDNF treatment significantly enhanced SGN survival. CNTF did not significantly enhance the protective effect of BDNF. These data present possible strategies for enhancing SGN survival in cochlear implant procedures. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel."+char(34)+"",

The study goal was to determine the histopathologic changes of the vestibular end organs after cochlear implantation and to relate them to clinical performance.STUDY DESIGN., To differentiate the effect of implantation from the disease process that originally destroyed the hearing, I I pairs of temporal bones from unilateral implantees were studied with light microscopy to compare the vestibular damage in the implanted ears with that in the nonimplanted ears.RESULTS. Significant histopathologic damage of the vestibular end organs was noted in 6 patients (54.5%). The major histopathologic findings were fibrosis in the vestibule, saccule membrane distortion, new bone formation, and reactive neuromas. The scala vestibuli involvement, as a result of damage to the osseous spiral lamina or basilar membrane in cochlear basal turn, was highly correlated with vestibular damage (75%).CONCLUSIONS: Although the clinical incidence of balance disturbance after cochlear implantation is low, damage of the vestibular end organs may occur and be asymptomatic. Keeping the electrode array in the scala tympani will minimize vestibular damage."+char(34)+"",

Preoperative and postoperative NRI recordings were made, applying various combinations of monopolar stimulating and recording electrodes with the alternating polarity paradigm available in the test bench software.Results: Nine patients preferred the CIS, one the PPS strategy, none the SAS strategy. With their favorite strategy they acquired significant open set speech understanding within a few weeks, resulting in an average CVC phoneme score of 84% (word score 66%) at the end of the study (follow-up 3 to 11 mo). In speech-shaped noise, the average phoneme recognition threshold (PRT) was reached at a signal to noise ratio just below 0 dB. The NRI recordings had clear N-1 and P-1 peaks if there was at least one contact between the stimulating and recording electrodes, necessitating just 15 sweeps for a reliable recording. We observed considerable interpatient and interelectrode variability, but for a given situation NRI input/output curves were stable over time. More apical contacts generally elicited larger eCAPs. Response amplitudes tended to peak at recording sites around apical and basal stimulating electrodes, suggesting a limited spread of excitation. Preliminary recordings with the forward masking paradigm were consistent with the ones with the alternating polarity scheme.Conclusions: The Clarion CII is a promising cochlear implant with which our first 10 patients have obtained excellent speech perception results. The NRI system yields high quality signals with a limited number of sweeps at high sampling rate."+char(34)+"",

		"Examining the Electro-Neural Interface of Cochlear Implant Users Using Psychophysics, CT Scans, and Speech Understanding"+char(34)+"",
		"This study examines the relationship between focused-stimulation thresholds, electrode positions, and speech understanding in deaf subjects treated with a cochlear implant (CI). Focused stimulation is more selective than monopolar stimulation, which excites broad regions of the cochlea, so may be more sensitive as a probe of neural survival patterns. Focused thresholds are on average higher and more variable across electrodes than monopolar thresholds. We presume that relatively high focused thresholds are the result of larger distances between the electrodes and the neurons. Two factors are likely to contribute to this distance: (1) the physical position of electrodes relative to the modiolus, where the excitable auditory neurons are normally located, and (2) the pattern of neural survival along the length of the cochlea, since local holes in the neural population will increase the distance between an electrode and the nearest neurons. Electrode-to-modiolus distance was measured from high-resolution CT scans of the cochleae of CI users whose focused-stimulation thresholds were also measured. A hierarchical set of linear models of electrode-to- modiolus distance versus threshold showed a significant increase in threshold with electrode-to-modiolus distance (average slope=11 dB/mm). The residual of these models was hypothesized to reflect neural survival in each subject. Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant (CNC) word scores were significantly correlated with the withinsubject variance of threshold (r(2)=0.82), but not with within-subject variance of electrode distance (r(2)=0.03). Speech understanding also significantly correlated with how well distance explained each subject's threshold data (r(2)=0.63). That is, subjects with focused thresholds that were well described by electrode position had better speech scores. Our results suggest that speech understanding is highly impacted by individual patterns of neural survival and that these patterns manifest themselves in how well (or poorly) electrode position predicts focused thresholds."+char(34)+"",

		"Transgenic BDNF induces nerve fiber regrowth into the auditory epithelium in deaf cochleae",
		"Sensory organs typically use receptor cells and afferent neurons to transduce environmental signals and transmit them to the CNS. When sensory cells are lost, nerves often regress from the sensory area. Therapeutic and regenerative approaches would benefit from the presence of nerve fibers in the tissue. In the hearing system, retraction of afferent innervation may accompany the degeneration of auditory hair cells that is associated with permanent hearing loss. The only therapy currently available for cases with severe or complete loss of hair cells is the cochlear implant auditory prosthesis. To enhance the therapeutic benefits of a cochlear implant, it is necessary to attract nerve fibers back into the cochlear epithelium. Here we show that forced expression of the neurotrophin gene BDNF in epithelial or mesothelial cells that remain in the deaf ear induces robust regrowth of nerve fibers towards the cells that secrete the neurotrophin, and results in re-innervation of the sensory area. The process of neurotrophin-induced neuronal regeneration is accompanied by significant preservation of the spiral ganglion cells. The ability to regrow nerve fibers into the basilar membrane area and protect the auditory nerve will enhance performance of cochlear implants and augment future cell replacement therapies such as stem cell implantation or induced transdifferentiation. This model also provides a general experimental stage for drawing nerve fibers into a tissue devoid of neurons, and studying the interaction between the nerve fibers and the tissue.

Another seven children had longer periods of bilateral deafness (>3 yr) before the first implant and received their second after a long (>2 yr) interimplant delay. Mean (standard deviation) of bilateral implant use was 12.5 (7.9) months ranging from 6 to 36 months. Repeated measures in quiet were completed in three quiet and two noise (no spatial separation) conditions. In quiet, children listened with their right implant alone, left implant alone, and with both implants. In noise, children wore one implant in the experienced (or right for simultaneous group) ear and both implants.Results: Speech perception scores were poorer in noise than in quiet, but significant improvements were found when bilateral rather than unilateral implants were worn. Improvements were greatest for children who were implanted with a short duration of bilateral deafness and a limited interimplant interval.Conclusion: Benefits of bilateral implantation in the short term are clearest in children with limited delays between implantation."+char(34)+"",

		"Interaural time and level difference thresholds for acoustically presented signals in post-lingually deafened adults fitted with bilateral cochlear implants using CIS plus processing",
		"Objectives: The main purpose of the study was to measure thresholds for interaural time differences (ITDs) and interaural level differences (ILDs) for acoustically presented noise signals in adults with bilateral cochlear implants (CIs). A secondary purpose was to assess the correlation between the ILD and ITD thresholds and error scores in a horizontal-plane localization task, to test the hypothesis that localization by individuals with bilateral implants is mediated by the processing of ILD cues.Design: Eleven adults, all postlingually deafened and all bilaterally fitted with MED-EL COMBI 40+ CIs, were tested in ITD and ILD discrimination tasks in which signals were presented acoustically through headphones that fit over their two devices. The stimulus was a 200-msec burst of Gaussian noise bandpass filtered from 100 to 4000 Hz. A two-interval forced-choice adaptive procedure was used in which the subject had to respond on each trial whether the lateral positions of the two sound images (with the interaural difference favoring the left and right sides in the two intervals) moved from left-to-right or right-to-left.Results. In agreement with previously reported data, ITD thresholds for the subjects with bilateral implants were poor. The best threshold was similar to 400 mu sec, and only five of 11 subjects tested achieved thresholds <1000 mu sec. In contrast, ILD thresholds were relatively good; mean threshold was 3.8 dB with the initial compression circuit on the implant devices activated and 1.9 dB with the compression deactivated. The ILD and ITD thresholds were higher than previously reported thresholds obtained with direct electrical stimulation (generally, < 1.0 dB and 100 to 200 mu sec, respectively). When the data from two outlying subjects were omitted, ILD thresholds were highly correlated with total error score in a horizontal-plane localization task, computed for sources near midline (r = 0.87, p < 0.01).Conclusions. The higher ILD and ITD thresholds obtained in this study with acoustically presented signals (when compared with prior data with direct electrical stimulation) can be attributed-at least partially-to the signal processing carried out by the CI in the former case. The processing strategy effectively leaves only envelope information as a basis for ITD discrimination, which, for the acoustically presented noise stimuli, is mainly coded in the onset information. The operation of the compression circuit reduces the ILDs in the signal, leading to elevated ILD thresholds for the acoustically presented signals in this condition. The large magnitude of the ITD thresholds indicates that ITDs could not have contributed to the performance in the horizontal-plane localization task. Overall, the results suggest that for subjects using bilateral implants, localization of noise signals is mediated entirely by ILD cues, with little or no contribution from ITD information."+char(34)+"",

		"Learning electrically stimulated speech patterns can be a new and difficult experience for cochlear implant (CI) recipients. Recent studies have shown that most implant recipients at least partially adapt to these new patterns via passive, daily-listening experiences. Gradually introducing a speech processor parameter (eg, the degree of spectral mismatch) may provide for more complete and less stressful adaptation. Although the implant device restores hearing sensation and the continued use of the implant provides some degree of adaptation, active auditory rehabilitation may be necessary to maximize the benefit of implantation for CI recipients. Currently, there are scant resources for auditory rehabilitation for adult, postlingually deafened CI recipients. We recently developed a computer-assisted speech-training program to provide the means to conduct auditory rehabilitation at home. The training software targets important acoustic contrasts among speech stimuli, provides auditory and visual feedback, and incorporates progressive training techniques, thereby maintaining recipients' interest during the auditory training exercises. Our recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of targeted auditory training in improving CI recipients' speech and music perception. Provided with an inexpensive and effective auditory training program, CI recipients may find the motivation and momentum to get the most from the implant device."+char(34)+"",

		"Auditory prosthesis with a penetrating nerve array",
		"Contemporary auditory prostheses ("+char(34)+"cochlear implants"+char(34)+") employ arrays of stimulating electrodes implanted in the scala tympani of the cochlea. Such arrays have been implanted in some 100,000 profoundly or severely deaf people worldwide and arguably are the most successful of present-day neural prostheses. Nevertheless, most implant users show poor understanding of speech in noisy backgrounds, poor pitch recognition, and poor spatial hearing, even when using bilateral implants. Many of these limitations can be attributed to the remote location of stimulating electrodes relative to excitable cochlear neural elements. That is, a scala tympani electrode array lies within a bony compartment filled with electrically conductive fluid. Moreover, scala tympani arrays typically do not extend to the apical turn of the cochlea in which low frequencies are represented. In the present study, we have tested in an animal model an alternative to the conventional cochlear implant: a multielectrode array implanted directly into the auditory nerve. We monitored the specificity of stimulation of the auditory pathway by recording extracellular unit activity at 32 sites along the tonotopic axis of the inferior colliculus. The results demonstrate the activation of specific auditory nerve populations throughout essentially the entire frequency range that is represented by characteristic frequencies in the inferior colliculus. Compared to conventional scala tympani stimulation, thresholds for neural excitation are as much as 50-fold lower and interference between electrodes stimulated simultaneously is markedly reduced. The results suggest that if an intraneural stimulating array were incorporated into an auditory prosthesis system for humans, it could offer substantial improvement in hearing replacement compared to contemporary cochlear implants."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: To determine if exogenous neurotrophins can prevent spiral ganglion neuron degeneration in the rat cochlea.Background: The loss of hair cells resulting in sensorineural hearing loss also leads to the secondary degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons. The effectiveness of cochlear implantation in patients with profound sensorineural hearing loss relies in part on the survival of spiral ganglion neurons; therefore, any therapy that can prevent or halt the loss of these neurons would be of potential clinical benefit. Previous research has shown that intracochlear infusion with neurotrophins can provide trophic support to SGNs in deafened guinea pigs. Whether this effect is seen in other species remains to be determined.Methods: After documenting the rate of spiral ganglion neuron degeneration after ototoxic deafening, we investigated the trophic effects of exogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on rat spiral ganglion neurons. The left cochleae of profoundly deafened rats were implanted with a drug delivery system connected to a mini-osmotic pump. BDNF or artificial perilymph was infused for 28 days; then the cochleae were prepared for histological study.Results: Treatment with BDNF led to a statistically significant increase in spiral ganglion neuron density and a highly significant increase in spiral ganglion neuron soma area compared with artificial perilymph-treated and untreated deafened cochleae.Conclusion: The study has demonstrated the trophic advantage of exogenous BDNF in the mature rat cochlea and provides confidence that spiral ganglion neuron rescue after sensorineural hearing loss with exogenous BDNF may have clinical application."+char(34)+"",

The deaf children displayed longer sentence durations and pauses during recall and shorter digit spans compared to the normal-hearing children. Articulation rates, measured from sentence durations, were strongly correlated with immediate memory span in both normal-hearing and deaf children, indicating that both slower subvocal rehearsal and scanning processes may be factors that contribute to the deaf children's shorter digit spans. These findings demonstrate that subvocal verbal rehearsal speed and memory scanning processes are not only dependent on chronological age as suggested in earlier research by Cowan and colleagues (1998). Instead, in this clinical population the absence of early auditory experience and phonological processing activities before implantation appears to produce measurable effects on the working memory processes that rely on verbal rehearsal and serial scanning of phonological information in short-term memory.

		"A temporal bone study of insertion trauma and intracochlear position of cochlear implant electrodes. 1: comparison of Nucleus banded and Nucleus Contour (TM) electrodes",
		"In recent years, new designs of cochlear implant electrodes have been introduced in an attempt to improve efficiency and performance by locating stimulation sites closer to spiral ganglion neurons and deeper into the scala tympani. The goal of this study was to document insertion depth, intracochlear position and insertion trauma with the Nucleus Contour (TM) electrode and to compare results to those observed with the earlier generation Nucleus banded electrode.For this comparison eight Nucleus banded electrodes and 18 Contour (TM) electrodes were implanted in cadaver temporal bones using a realistic surgical exposure. Two experienced cochlear implant surgeons and two otology fellows with specialized training in cochlear implant surgery were selected for the study to represent a range of surgical experience similar to that of surgeons currently performing the procedure throughout the world. Following insertion of the electrodes, specimens were imaged using plain film X-ray, embedded in acrylic resin, cut in radial sections with the electrodes in place, and each cut surface was polished. Insertion depth was measured in digitized X-ray images, and trauma was assessed in each cross-section.The Contour (TM) electrode inserted more deeply (mean depth = 17.9 mm or 417 degrees) than the banded electrode (mean depth = 15.3 mm or 285 degrees). The incidence and severity of trauma varied Substantially among the temporal bones studied. However, the nature and frequency of injuries observed with the two devices were very similar. The Contour (TM) electrode was clearly positioned closer to the modiolus than the banded model, and also appeared easier to use. Based on this difference in position and data from previous studies we conclude that the Contour- electrode may provide lower thresholds and improved channel selectivity, but the incidence of trauma remains a problem with the newer design. The relative influences of electrode positioning and neural degeneration that may result from trauma are as yet unclear. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."+char(34)+"",

		"Mandarin tone recognition in cochlear-implant subjects",
		"This study examined tone recognition in five cochlear-implant subjects who were native speakers of Mandarin and used a Nucleus-22 device. Psychophysical experiments were conduced to measure rate discrimination in individual electrodes from the most apical to the most basal electrodes. The rate range was from 100 to 200 Hz, which corresponded to the range of variation in fundamental frequency for the tonal tokens used in this study. Speech recognition experiments were also conducted to measure tone recognition as function of the number of electrodes from a 1-electrode map to a 20-electrode map. Large individual variability was observed for both rate discrimination and tone recognition result: Average rate discrimination ranged between 0.2 and 1.2 (Weber's fraction) whereas tone recognition ranged between 30% and 70% correct. A highly significant correlation was found between rate discrimination and tone recognition with the 20-electrode map, but a non-significant correlation was observed with the 1-electrode map due to a floor effect in tone recognition. The present result supports the hypothesis that both spectral and temporal cues contribute to tone recognition. In addition, the present result shows that current cochlear-implant subjects produced significantly lower performance than acoustic simulations in normal-hearing subjects, suggesting that neither temporal nor spectral cues have been adequately and appropriately extracted and encoded in current cochlear implants. New designs are discussed to improve tone recognition in cochlear implant subjects. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."+char(34)+"",

		"In a temporal bone study of 26 ears from 13 patients who, in life, had severe sensorineural hearing loss, the segmental and total spiral ganglion cell (SGC) counts were correlated with hearing thresholds and with the difference between hearing thresholds in the two ears, the age at death, the duration of deafness, and the duration of hearing loss. A statistically significant correlation was found between the interaural differences in total SGC counts and the interaural difference in pure tone averages for 3, 4, and 5 frequencies. The total SGC count was higher in the ear with the better residual hearing in 11 of 12 cases. Approximately 41% of the variability in interaural difference in pure tone average was explained by the difference in SGC counts. The findings would suggest that in a given individual, selection of the ear with better residual hearing for cochlear implantation is likely to result in accessing a higher number of residual SGCs.

		"There have been few studies investigating the mechanism and nature of the hearing loss that occurs in the mitochondrial disorders. We studied 18 patients with the MELAS A3243G point mutation from four different kindreds. Pure tone audiometry, speech discrimination testing, acoustic reflexes, tympanometry, and brain stem auditory evoked responses were performed to localize the site of pathology in the auditory pathways. In 12 patients, we performed electrocochleography and otoacoustic emissions to assess cochlear involvement. Neuroimaging and promontory nerve stimulation were performed to exclude retrocochlear pathology. Audiological testing confirmed sensorineural hearing loss in 14 of the 18 patients studied; hearing loss was usually gradual in onset, was symmetrical, and initially affected the higher frequencies. In some patients, there were features that distinguished the hearing loss from presbyacusis, including a young age at onset, asymmetrical involvement, stepwise progression, and partial recovery. We treated one patient who had profound bilateral hearing loss with cochlear implantation; this restored good functional hearing. Hearing loss in MELAS syndrome appears to be due to dysfunction of the cochlea, probably resulting from metabolic failure of the stria vascularis and outer hair cells.

		"Hypothesis: The goals of this work were (a) to review the pre- and postsurgical auditory thresholds in a consecutive sample of cochlear implant recipients to determine the fate of residual hearing, and (b) to obtain preliminary indication of the value of a multicenter longitudinal study of residual hearing in implant patients.Background: Indications for cochlear implantation have been expanded to include severely hearing impaired (SHI) adults and may someday include SHI children. Implantation of individuals with more residual hearing is a concern owing to the possible development of better devices that may make use of residual hearing within the lifetime of implanted children if not that of adults. Preservation of residual hearing would be a desirable outcome of implant surgery; however, conventional thought is that implantation destroys any remaining hearing. This study was undertaken to assess if and how often conservation of hearing occurred after implantation in a sample of multichannel implant recipients.Methods: Records of 50 profoundly hearing impaired consecutively implanted patients were examined for pre- and postsurgical audiometric results. Standard audiometric techniques were used for all testing procedures. Forty patients were considered to have some hearing conserved based on a response obtained at any one of the three speech frequencies prior to implantation. The most recent postimplantation audiometric results were used providing data from users with 1-41 months of use.Results: Twenty-one of 40 implanted subjects were found to have responses in at least one of the speech frequencies both pre- and postsurgery, with the majority of those displaying responses at all three frequencies. In this preliminary retrospective study, it did not appear that duration of cochlear implant use, sender, level of preoperative hearing, or length of electrode insertion were related to outcome. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions on individual devices.Conclusions: Conservation of hearing occurred in approximately half of the subjects reviewed. There is no indication of what factors contributed to the preservation of hearing in those with postsurgical residual hearing or if that hearing is usable. The study does suggest that a larger multicenter longitudinal study would be of value to determine what factors may be related to conserved hearing in implanted patients."+char(34)+"",

		"Technological, biological, and acoustical constraints to music perception in cochlear implant users"+char(34)+"",
		"Despite advances in technology, the ability to perceive music remains limited for many cochlear implant users. This paper reviews the technological, biological, and acoustical constraints that make music an especially challenging stimulus for cochlear implant users, while highlighting recent research efforts to overcome these shortcomings. The limitations of cochlear implant devices, which have been optimized for speech comprehension, become evident when applied to music, particularly with regards to inadequate spectral, fine-temporal, and dynamic range representation. Beyond the impoverished information transmitted by the device itself, both peripheral and central auditory nervous system deficits are seen in the presence of sensorineural hearing loss, such as auditory nerve degeneration and abnormal auditory cortex activation. These technological and biological constraints to effective music perception are further compounded by the complexity of the acoustical features of music itself that require the perceptual integration of varying rhythmic, melodic, harmonic, and timbral elements of sound. Cochlear implant users not only have difficulty perceiving spectral components individually (leading to fundamental disruptions in perception of pitch, melody, and harmony) but also display deficits with higher perceptual integration tasks required for music perception, such as auditory stream segregation. Despite these current limitations, focused musical training programs, new assessment methods, and improvements in the representation and transmission of the complex acoustical features of music through technological innovation offer the potential for significant advancements in cochlear implant-mediated music perception.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled <Music: A window into the hearing brain>.

Four of these ears failed auditory stimulation after cochlear implantation, confirming clinically significant CND. Of 15 ears with a narrow IAC and a single nerve visible on MR1, 2 (13.3%) had a normal-size BCNC, 4 (26.7%) were narrow, and 9 (60.0%) were absent. One ear with a narrow IAC, normal BCNC, and a single nerve as revealed by MRI has benefited from cochlear implantation.Conclusion: Using BCNC patency, as revealed by HRCT, as a means of identifying CND would miss all cases of absent CNs in the setting of a normal-size IAC. Thus, MRI should be the primary modality for imaging children with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. When MRI demonstrates a single nerve within a narrow IAC, the addition of HRCT can further identify more than half of these cases as involving absent CNs because of an absent BCNC.

		"Speech comprehension is resistant to acoustic distortion in the input, reflecting listeners' ability to adjust perceptual processes to match the speech input. This adjustment is reflected in improved comprehension of distorted speech with experience. For noise vocoding, a manipulation that removes spectral detail from speech, listeners' word report showed a significantly greater improvement over trials for listeners that heard clear speech presentations before rather than after hearing distorted speech (clear-then-distorted compared with distorted-then-clear feedback, in Experiment 1). This perceptual learning generalized to untrained words suggesting a sublexical locus for learning and was equivalent for word and nonword training stimuli (Experiment 2). These findings point to the crucial involvement of phonological short-term memory and top-down processes in the perceptual learning of noise-vocoded speech.

In the second experiment, vowel identification was measured as a function of the F0 difference between two simultaneous vowels in six normal-hearing listeners, with the number of vocoder channels (8 and 24 channels, and unprocessed) as a parameter.Results: Reverberation was detrimental to F0 discrimination in conditions with fewer numbers of vocoder channels. Despite the reasonable F0DLs (< 1 semitone) with 24- and 8-channel vocoder processing, listeners were unable to benefit from F0 differences between the competing vowels in the concurrent-vowel paradigm.Conclusions: The overall detrimental effects of vocoder processing are probably are due to the poor spectral representation of the lower-order harmonics. The F0 information carried in the temporal envelope is weak, susceptible to reverberation, and may not suffice for source segregation. To the extent that vocoder processing simulates cochlear implant processing, users of current implant processing schemes are unlikely to benefit from F0 differences between competing talkers when listening to speech in complex environments. The results provide further incentive for finding a way to make the information from low-order, resolved harmonics available to cochlear implant users."+char(34)+"",

Several studies suggest that the acoustic information that leads to the increased level of performance resides mostly in the frequency region of the voice fundamental, e. g. 125 Hz for a male voice. Recent studies suggest that this information aids speech recognition in noise by improving the recognition of lexical boundaries or word onsets. In some noise environments, patients with bilateral implants can achieve similar levels of performance as patients who combine electric and acoustic stimulation.

		"Exogenous delivery of neurotrophic factors into the cochlea of deafened animals rescues spiral ganglion cells (SGCs) from degeneration. To be clinically relevant for human cochlear implant candidates, the protective effect of neurotrophins should persist after cessation of treatment and the treated SGCs should remain functional. In this study, the survival and functionality of SGCs were investigated after temporary treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Guinea pigs in the experimental group were deafened, and 2 weeks later, the right cochleae were implanted with an electrode array and drug delivery cannula. BDNF was administered to the implanted cochleae during a 4-week period via a mini-osmotic pump. After completion of the treatment, the osmotic pumps were removed. Two weeks later, the animals were killed and the survival of SGCs was analyzed. To monitor the functionality of the auditory nerve, electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (eABRs) were recorded in awake animals throughout the experiment. BDNF treatment resulted in enhanced survival of SGCs 2 weeks after cessation of the treatment and prevented the decreases in size and circularity that are seen in the untreated contralateral cochleae. The amplitude of the suprathreshold eABR response in BDNF-treated animals was significantly larger than in deafened control animals and comparable to that in normal-hearing control animals. The amplitude in the BDNF-treated group did not decrease significantly after cessation of treatment. The eABR latency in BDNF-treated animals was longer than normal and comparable to that in deafened control animals. These morphological and functional findings demonstrate that neurotrophic intervention had a lasting effect, which is promising for future clinical application of neurotrophic factors in implanted human cochleae."+char(34)+"",

		"Maximizing cochlear implant patients' performance with advanced speech training procedures",
		"Advances in implant technology and speech processing have provided great benefit to many cochlear implant patients. However, some patients receive little benefit from the latest technology, even after many years' experience with the device. Moreover, even the best cochlear implant performers have great difficulty understanding speech in background noise, and music perception and appreciation remain major challenges. Recent studies have shown that targeted auditory training can significantly improve cochlear implant patients' speech recognition performance. Such benefits are not only observed in poorly performing patients, but also in good performers under difficult listening conditions (e.g., speech noise, telephone speech, music, etc.). Targeted auditory training has also been shown to enhance performance gains provided by new implant devices and/or speech processing strategies. These studies suggest that cochlear implantation alone may not fully meet the needs of many patients, and that additional auditory rehabilitation may be needed to maximize the benefits of the implant device. Continuing research will aid in the development of efficient and effective training protocols and materials, thereby minimizing the costs (in terms of time, effort and resources) associated with auditory rehabilitation while maximizing the benefits of cochlear implantation for all recipients.

In this study, the auditory skills of children using bilateral cochlear implants were evaluated.Study design and settings: Qualitative data based on free observations in the rehabilitation setup were collected in 39 bilaterally implanted children. A speech discrimination in noise test was performed in 18 of these children; lists of bisyllabic words were presented in noise at a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of +15 dB.Results: Qualitative and quantitative data show clearly that bilateral CI improves the children's communicative behaviour, especially in complex listening situations. Children examined with the speech in noise test scored significantly better under the bilateral condition compared to the unilateral condition. Integration of the second implanted side and use of binaural information was observed to be easier and faster in children with a short time tag between both implants.Conclusions: To be able to obtain optimal benefit from bilateral cochlear implants, an intensive rehabilitation program is necessary. The important aspects of such a program are creating realistic expectations in older children before implantation; performing the first processor fitting of the second side with the first side switched on; and separate intensive training with the new system in order to balance out the hearing competence of the second CI with that of the first.

Our purpose was to determine how well a prototypical volume CT (VCT) scanner with a flat-panel detector system defines fine structures in temporal bone.METHODS: Four partially manipulated temporalbone specimens were imaged by use of a prototypical cone-beam VCT scanner with a flat-panel detector system at an isometric resolution of 150 mum at the isocenter. These specimens were also depicted by state-of-the-art multisection CT (MSCT). Forty-two structures imaged by both scanners were qualitatively assessed and rated, and scores assigned to VCT findings were compared with those of MSCT.RESULTS: Qualitative assessment of anatomic structures, lesions, cochlear implants, and middle-ear hearing aids indicated that image quality was significantly better with VCT (P < .001). Structures near the spatial-resolution limit of MSCT (e.g., bony covering of the tympanic segment of the facial canal, the incudo-stapedial joint, the proximal vestibular aqueduct, the interscalar septum, and the modiolus) had higher contrast and less partial-volume effect with VCT.CONCLUSION: The flat-panel prototype provides better definition of fine osseous structures of temporal bone than that of currently available MSCT scanners. This study provides impetus for further research in increasing spatial resolution beyond that offered by the current state-of-the-art scanners."+char(34)+"",

		"OBJECTIVE. Recently, the association of meningitis with cochlear implants has raised concern over the safety of these devices. We examined the incidence of all postoperative infections in patients undergoing cochlear implant surgery.STUDY DESIGN AND SETTINGS: A retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing cochlear implants at a private tertiary referral center from 1993 to 2002 was performed. Cochlear implant surgeries in 462 adults and 271 children were reviewed. Patients with evidence of a postoperative infection or infectious complication related to cochlear implantation were identified, and data on patient characteristics, surgery, and treatment outcome were obtained.RESULTS: The overall incidence of postoperative infection in our cochlear implant series was 4.1%. Major infectious complications occurred in 3.0% of cases, and the majority of infections required surgical intervention. A history of chronic ear disease may increase the risk of infectious complications. There were no cases of meningitis.CONCLUSIONS: Cochlear implants remain a safe procedure with a low complication rate. The majority of infections can be managed without removing the implant device. Advances in surgical technique and flap design have decreased the occurrence of wound-related complications. However, identification of risk factors for infection and optimization of treatment regimens will further reduce the complications associated with postoperative infection."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the speech development of children with at least 2 years' hearing experience with a cochlear implant (CI). Methods: One hundred and six children were tested, all of whom had used the Cl for at least 2 years. Receptive and expressive language development were tested using the scales of early communication skills for hearing-impaired children after Geers and Moog and the Reynell developmental language scales III. In addition, freefield audiometry was performed. Pre-postoperative measurements were compared statistically, and a linear regression analysis was carried out. Results: Clear improvements in the gain in functional hearing 2 years after receiving the CI as well as clear improvements in both speech perception and speech production were ascertained. All deviations were statistically highly significant (P < 0.000). The receptive and expressive speech test results correlate positively to a great extent. The results of logistic regressive analysis indicate that the speech production measured depends decisively on age at implantation, age at time of test, speech production before implantation, and additional handicaps. Conclusion: Based on the conception of the WHO, a statistically significant improvement of both impairment and disability can be confirmed. In the present study, the regression analysis established the age at implantation as the most important prognostic factor. While the percentage of children with good speech development is larger with early implanted children than with late implanted children, some of the children among the early implanted group show unsatisfactory speech development of unknown origin. Improvements in speech development are likely to be achieved when more children are diagnosed and implanted early. This finding urgently requires the introduction of a general newborn screening program. Thorough anamnesis and assessment during parent counseling of the manifold factors described are a prerequisite for the precise estimation of the difficulties to be met and the expected effectiveness of the implant in each individual case.

		"The effect of interpulse intervals on the perception of loudness of biphasic current pulse trains was investigated in eight adult cochlear implantees at three different stimulus levels encompassing the psychophysical dynamic range. Equal-loudness contours and thresholds were obtained for stimuli in which two biphasic pulses were presented in a fixed repetition period (4 and 20 ms), and also for single-pulse/period stimuli with rates varying between 20 and 750 Hz. All stimuli were of 500-ms duration, and the-phase durations of each pulse were 100 mu s or less. The results of these experiments were consistent with predictions of a three-stage model of loudness perception, consisting of a peripheral refractory effect function, a sliding central integration time window, and a central equal-loudness decision device. Application of the model to the data allowed the estimation of neural refractory characteristics of the subjects' remaining peripheral neural population. The average neural spike probability for a 50-Hz stimulus was predicted to be about 0.77, with an associated neural refractory time of 7.3 ms. These predictions did not vary systematically with level, implying that the effect of increasing current level on loudness results more from recruitment of neurons than from any increase in average spike probability.

Most children received intervention services from a certified auditoryverbal therapist or an auditory-oral therapist and weekly sign language instruction from an instructor who was deaf or hard of hearing and native or fluent in American Sign Language.Main Outcome Measures: The Test of Auditory Comprehension of Language, 3rd Edition, and the Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, 3rd Edition, were the assessment tools for children 4 to 7 years of age. The expressive language subscale of the Minnesota Child Development was used in the infant/toddler period (birth to 36 mo).Results: Average language estimates at 84 months of age were nearly identical to the normative sample for receptive language and 7 months delayed for expressive vocabulary. Children demonstrated a mean rate of growth from 4 years through 7 years on these 2 assessments that was equivalent to their normal-hearing peers. As a group, children with hearing aids deviated more from the age equivalent trajectory on the Test of Auditory Comprehension of Language, 3rd Edition, and the Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, 3rd Edition, than children with cochlear implants.

However, it is easier to maintain a constant rate of development rather than to accelerate from birth through 84 months of age, which represented approximately 80% of our sample.

		"Objective: The purpose of the study is to present the results of cochlear implantation in case of deafness involving mutations in the OTOF gene. This form of deafness is characterized by the presence of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE). In cases of profound deafness with preserved TEOAE, two main etiologies should be considered: either an auditory neuropathy (a retrocochlear lesion) or an endocochlear lesion. It is essential to differentiate these two entities with regards to therapy and screening.Patients: We report two children who presented with profound prelingual deafness, confirmed by the absence of detectable responses to auditory evoked potentials (AEP), associated with the presence of bilateral TEOAE. Genetic testing revealed mutations in OTOF, confirming DFNB9 deafness. Both patients have been successfully implanted (with a followup of 18 and 36 months, respectively).Main outcome measures: Clinical (oral production, closed and open-set words and sentences list, meaningful auditory integration scale), audiometric evaluation (TEOAE, AEP) before and after implantation, and neural response telemetry (NRT).Results: Both patients present a good quality of clinical responses and electrophysiollogical tests after implantation, indicating satisfactory functioning of the auditory nerve. This confirms the endocochlear origin of DFNB9 and suggests that these mutations in OTOF lead to functional atteration of inner hair cells.Conclusion: In the absence of a context of neurological syndrome, the combination of absent AEP and positive TEOAE should lead to a genetic screening for mutations in OTOF, in order to undertake the appropriate management.

		"Device-related infections: a review.",
		"The use of surgically implanted devices has increased as a result of their beneficial effect on quality of life, and in some circumstances, on patient survival rates. They can, however, be associated with a variety of complications, the most dreaded being infection. Device-related infections are important to understand because of the morbidity and mortality associated with them. Frequently, patients are managed with hospitalization, prolonged courses of antibiotics, and surgical interventions, all of which can negatively impact on patients' quality of life. Such care is also associated with increased costs to health care systems. Furthermore, these infections often represent a diagnostic challenge because of the lack of consensus definition of what constitutes an infection and its severity, as well as the paucity of well-designed, large studies addressing optimal methods of investigation and management. An implant-associated infection is defined as a host immune response to one or more microbial pathogens on an indwelling implant. An understanding of the pathogenesis of these infections provides a rationale for management. Development of device-related infections begins with colonization of the foreign material, followed by a complex metamorphosis by the microorganisms with resultant biofilm formation. In this surface-associated form, bacteria have altered phenotypic properties. This change, in conjunction with the physical protective layer provided by the biofilm, renders antimicrobial therapy ineffective when used alone. Because the microorganisms are able to reside on the hardware, they proliferate and cause local damage, such as loosening of implanted devices, wound dehiscence, or disruption of prosthetic valves, as well as systemic manifestations, such as fever or embolic phenomenon. The onset and clinical manifestations of device-related infections vary with the pathogen involved, as well as which component of the device is affected. The time period after device implantation that signs and symptoms develop can assist in the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Optimal diagnostic microbiologic specimens are paramount in tailoring the antimicrobial therapy, which almost always has to be given for a prolonged period of time. Surgical removal of the device is usually necessary. Some studies of limited types of device-related infections, however, have defined indications for which salvage therapy may be warranted. In addition, some patients are not candidates for, or may not want, further surgical interventions, in which case indefinite suppressive antimicrobial therapy may be considered. This review provides an overview of infections related to various neurosurgical, cardiac, and orthopedic devices, as well as those related to cochlear, breast, and penile prostheses, with discussion of definitions of such infections, along with microbiology, pathogenesis, and management guidelines, including the limited indications for salvage techniques."+char(34)+"",

		"Effect of mismatched place-of-stimulation on binaural fusion and lateralization in bilateral cochlearimplant users",
		"Bilateral cochlear implants (CIs) have provided some success in improving spatial hearing abilities to patients, but with large variability in performance. One reason for the variability is that there may be a mismatch in the place-of-stimulation arising from electrode arrays being inserted at different depths in each cochlea. Goupell et al. [(2013b). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 133(4), 2272-2287] showed that increasing interaural mismatch led to non-fused auditory images and poor lateralization of interaural time differences in normal hearing subjects listening to a vocoder. However, a greater bandwidth of activation helped mitigate these effects. In the present study, the same experiments were conducted in post-lingually deafened bilateral CI users with deliberate and controlled interaural mismatch of single electrode pairs. Results show that lateralization was still possible with up to 3 mm of interaural mismatch, even when off-center, or multiple, auditory images were perceived. However, mismatched inputs are not ideal since it leads to a distorted auditory spatial map. Comparison of CI and normal hearing listeners showed that the CI data were best modeled by a vocoder using Gaussian-pulsed tones with 1.5 mm bandwidth. These results suggest that interaural matching of electrodes is important for binaural cues to be maximally effective. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America."+char(34)+"",

This is the first quantitative report of the impact of implantation on the vestibular neuronal end organ.Methods: There were 19 temporal bones available for histologic study. Of these, 17 were suitable for the description of the morphology of the membranous labyrinth, 8 for counting Scarpa's ganglion cells, and 6 for measuring the densities of vestibular hair cells. The bones were fixed, cut, and stained according to previously published methods. Preferably, the implanted electrode was left in situ. Vestibular hair cells were counted with Nomarski's optics.Results: Differences in Scarpa's ganglion cell counts and hair cell densities between the implanted and nonimplanted sides were not statistically significant. In 59% of the implanted bones, the cochlea was hydropic, and in the majority of these bones the saccule was collapsed.Conclusion: Cochlear implantation does not cause deafferentation of the peripheral vestibular system. Cochlear hydrops accompanied by saccular collapse is common and may cause attacks of vertigo of delayed onset, similar to Meniere's syndrome as previously reported in several clinical series. Hydrops could be caused by obstruction of endolymphatic flow in the ductus reuniens or in the hook portion of the cochlea or by damage to the lateral cochlear wall caused by implantation."+char(34)+"",

We were unable to predict when the second ear would be the better performing ear, and by implanting both ears, we guarantee implanting the better ear. Sequential implantation with long delays between ears has resulted in poor second ear performance for some subjects and has limited the degree of bilateral benefit that can be obtained by these users.

		"Conclusions. Our study data demonstrate the additional benefit derived from continued use of a contralateral hearing aid (HA) post-cochlear implantation for speech recognition ability in quiet and in noise. Postoperative bimodal stimulation is recommended for all subjects who show some speech recognition ability in the contralateral ear as it may offer binaural listening advantages in various listening situations encountered in everyday life. Objectives. To assess the benefits derived from bimodal stimulation for experienced HA users implanted with a cochlear implant (CI) ( score >= 20% in disyllabic test). The correlation between pre- and postoperative performance on speech perception measures was examined to determine additional criteria for recommending bimodal stimulation postoperatively. Material and methods. A within-subject repeated-measures design was used, with each subject acting as their own control. Assessments were carried out preoperatively in aided monaural and best-aided conditions and at 6 months postoperatively in CI-alone, contralateral HA-alone and bimodal listening conditions. Speech recognition using Spanish words and sentences materials was assessed at conversational level and for soft speech in quiet. Speech comprehension in noise was assessed using word materials at a signal: noise ratio of + 10, for coincident speech in noise and for spatially separated speech in noise. Twelve adult native Spanish subjects with a severeto- profound hearing impairment who were experienced with optimally fitted conventional amplification and who displayed suboptimal speech understanding preoperatively were enrolled in the study. Preoperatively, conventional amplification was worn by five subjects binaurally and by seven monaurally. Results. Postoperatively, superior speech recognition ability in quiet and in noise for disyllabic words was achieved using bimodal stimulation in comparison to performance for either monaural aided condition. Mean improvement in speech recognition in the bimodal condition was significant over performance in the CI-alone condition for disyllabic words in quiet at 70 ( p = 0.006) and 55 dB SPL ( p = 0.028), for disyllabic words in noise at + 10 dB with speech and noise spatially separated with the noise source closest to the contralateral HA (S0NHA) ( p = 0.0005) and when the noise source was closest to the CI ear (S0NCI) ( p = 0.002). When testing word recognition in noise with speech and noise sources coincident in space, word scores were superior in the bimodal condition relative to the CI-alone condition but this improvement was not significant ( p = 0.07). The advantages of bimodal stimulation included significant effects of binaural summation in quiet and significant binaural squelch effects in both the S0NHA and S0NCI test conditions.

		"Objective: The primary goals of this investigation were to examine the speech and language development of deaf children with cochlear implants and mild cognitive delay and to compare their gains with those of children with cochlear implants who do not have this additional impairment.Design: We retrospectively examined the speech and language development of 69 children with prelingual deafness. The experimental group consisted of 19 children with cognitive delays and no other disabilities (mean age at implantation = 38 months). The control group consisted of 50 children who did not have cognitive delays or any other identified disability. The control group was stratified by primary communication mode: half used total communication (mean age at implantation = 32 months) and the other half used oral communication (mean age at implantation = 26 months). Children were tested on a variety of standard speech and language measures and one test of auditory skill development at 6-month intervals.Results: The results from each test were collapsed from blocks of two consecutive 6-month intervals to calculate group mean scores before implantation and at 1-year intervals after implantation. The children with cognitive delays and those without such delays demonstrated significant improvement in their speech and language skills over time on every test administered. Children with cognitive delays had significantly lower scores than typically developing children on two of the three measures of receptive and expressive language and had significantly slower rates of auditory-only sentence recognition development. Finally, there were no significant group differences in auditory skill development based on parental reports or in auditory-only or multimodal word recognition.Conclusions: The results suggest that deaf children with mild cognitive impairments benefit from cochlear implantation. Specifically, improvements are evident in their ability to perceive speech and in their reception and use of language. However, it may be reduced relative to their typically developing peers with cochlear implants, particularly in domains that require higher level skills, such as sentence recognition and receptive and expressive language. These findings suggest that children with mild cognitive deficits be considered for cochlear implantation with less trepidation than has been the case in the past. Although their speech and language gains may be tempered by their cognitive abilities, these limitations do not appear to preclude benefit from cochlear implant stimulation, as assessed by traditional measures of speech and language development."+char(34)+"",

		"An improved method of reducing stimulus artifact in the electrically evoked whole-nerve potential",
		"Objective: Recording a compound action potential in response to electrical stimulation requires attention to minimize contamination due to electrical stimulus artifact. In patients implanted with the Nucleus(R) 24 device, the electrically evoked whole-nerve potential (EAP) is recorded using a neural response telemetry (NRT) system. This system employs a forward-masking technique that greatly reduces stimulus artifact. However, theoretical considerations and experimental animal data suggest that the technique may distort the acquired EAP waveform under some situations. We proposed and evaluated a modification to the forward-masking technique that addresses this concern, particularly during collection of refractory recovery data.Design: We first examined neural responses of the electrically stimulated auditory nerve using cat preparations. Through single-fiber recordings from cats, we demonstrated underlying physiological limitations likely encountered with the "+char(34)+"standard"+char(34)+" forward masking technique. We then recorded feline EAP waveforms using both the standard technique and our proposed, modified, technique. Finally, we collected EAP data from human cochlear implant patients using both artifact reduction methods. These comparisons allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of our modification.Results: The cat EAP data demonstrated that the standard forward-masking technique currently in use in the Nucleus(R) NRT system can distort the EAP waveform when the nerve is partially refractory. In the cat, this distortion resulted in forwardmasking recovery curves with artifactually prolonged recovery times and inaccurate latency trends. Similar effects were observed in the comparison of human recovery curves obtained using both the standard and modified techniques. In some cases, the modified technique produced EAP waveforms with more clearly defined peaks than were obtainable with the standard method.Conclusions: Consideration should be given to implementing our modified forward-masking artifact reduction scheme, because it introduces less distortion of the EAP waveform and accordingly provides for more accurate assessment of the refractory properties of the electrically stimulated nerve."+char(34)+"",

Experiment 1 measured phoneme recognition as a function of stimulation rate in six Nucleus-22 cochlear implant Listeners using an experimental four-channel continuous interleaved sampler (CIS) speech processing strategy. Results showed that all stimulation rates from 150 to 500 pulses/s/electrode produced equally good performance, while stimulation rates lower than 150 pulses/s/electrode produced significantly poorer performance. Experiment 2 measured phoneme recognition by implant listeners and normal-hearing listeners as a function of the low-pass cutoff frequency for envelope information. Results from both acoustic and electric hearing showed no significant difference in performance for all cutoff frequencies higher than 20 Hz. Both vowel and consonant scores dropped significantly when the cutoff frequency was reduced from 20 Hz to 2 Hz. The results of these two experiments suggest that temporal envelope information can be conveyed by relatively low stimulation rates.

The "+char(34)+"targetless"+char(34)+" criterion required the child to produce a phonetically recognizable sound spontaneously, and the "+char(34)+"target"+char(34)+" criterion required the child to produce the phone correctly at least 50% of the time in meaningful words. At 4 years post-implant, 40 out of 44 phones (91%) had reached the targetless criterion, and 29 phones (66%) had reached the target criterion for 5 or more of the children. Over the time of the study 100% of monophthongs, 63% of diphthongs, and 54% of consonants reached the target criterion. The average time taken For a phone to progress From the targetless to target criterion was 15 months. Overall, the data suggest trends in the order of phone acquisition similar to those of normally hearing children, although the process of acquisition occurred at a slower rate."+char(34)+"",

		"Relations between cochlear histopathology and hearing loss in experimental cochlear implantation",
		"This study reviews the cochlear histology from four hearing preservation cochlear implantation experiments conducted on 73 guinea pigs from our institution, and relates histopathological findings to residual hearing. All guinea pigs had normal hearing prior to surgery and underwent cochlear implantation via a cochleostomy with a silastic-platinum dummy electrode. Pure tone auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds from 2 to 32 kHz were recorded prior to surgery, and at one and four weeks post-operatively. The cochleae were then fixed in paraformaldehyde, decalcified, paraffin embedded, and mid-modiolar sections were prepared. The treatment groups were as follows: 1) Systemic dexamethasone, 0.2 mg/kg administered 1 h before implantation, 2) Local dexamethasone, 2% applied topically to the round window for 30 min prior to cochlear implantation, 3) Local n-acetyl cysteine, 200 jig applied topically to the round window for 30 min prior to implantation, 4) inoculation to keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (KLH) prior to implantation, and 5) untreated controls. There was a significant correlation between the extent of the tissue reaction in the cochlea and the presence of foreign body giant cells (FBGCs), new bone formation and injury to the osseous spiral lamina (OSL). The extent of the tissue response, as a percentage of the area of the scala tympani, limited the best hearing that was observed four weeks after cochlear implantation. Poorer hearing at four weeks correlated with a more extensive tissue response, lower outer hair cell (OHC) counts and OSL injury in the basal turn. Progressive hearing loss was also correlated with the extent of tissue response. Hearing at 2 kHz, which corresponds to the region of the second cochlear turn, did not correspond with loco-regional inner hair cell (IHC), OHC or SGC counts. We conclude that cochlear injury is associated with poorer hearing early after implantation. The tissue response is related to indices of cochlear inflammation and injury. An extensive tissue response limits hearing at four weeks, and correlates with progressive hearing loss. These latter effects may be due to inflammation, but would also be consistent with interference of cochlear mechanics. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

		"Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to determine whether a revision and/or expansion of current audiologic cochlear implant candidacy criteria is warranted.Design: The study design was a retrospective review of postoperative speech perception performance for 22 adult cochlear implant recipients who demonstrated preoperative Consonant Nucleus Consonant word recognition scores of 30% or higher in the best-aided condition. This criterion was chosen to exceed that specified by the North American clinical trial of the Nucleus Freedom cochlear implant system.Results: The mean preoperative best-aided monosyllabic word score for the 22 patients was 41% correct. The degree of postoperative benefit for the best postoperative condition (electric only or bimodal) ranged from 10 to 68 percentage points with a mean benefit of 27 percentage points for the electric-only condition and 40 percentage points for the bimodal condition. Statistical analyses revealed highly significant differences between preoperative-aided, implant-only, and bimodal performance on Consonant Nucleus Consonant monosyllabic word recognition performance. That is, both postoperative scores-electric only and bimodal-were significantly different from one another and from the preoperative best-aided performance.Conclusions: The current results suggest that a large-scale reassessment of manufacturer and Medicare preoperative audiologic candidacy criteria for adults is warranted to allow more hearing-impaired individuals to take advantage of the benefits offered by cochlear implantation."+char(34)+"",

		"Reading abilities after cochlear implantation: The effect of age at implantation on outcomes at 5 and 7 years after implantation",
		"Objectives: The reading skills of deaf children have typically been delayed and this delay has been found to increase with age. This study explored the reading ability of a large group of children who had received cochlear implants 7 years earlier and investigated the relationship between reading ability and age at implantation.Methods: The reading ages of 105 children, with age at implantation less than 7 years and onset of deafness below the age of three, were assessed 5 and 7 years after implantation using the Edinburgh reading test. Net reading age was calculated by using the difference between chronological age and reading age. Non-verbal intelligence was measured for a subset of 71 children, using Raven's coloured progressive matrices. Further investigation of this subset looked at the association of nonverbal intelligence, age at implantation and reading ability.Results: There was a strong negative correlation at both 5 and 7 years after implant between net reading score and age at implantation. In the subset of 71 children who had an IQ score within normal range, those implanted at or before 42 months had age-appropriate reading both 5 and 7 years post-implant. This was not the case for children implanted after 42 months. Reading progress at the two post-implant assessment intervals were found to be highly related.Conclusions: Age at implantation was a significant factor in the development of reading skills in this group. In children implanted below the age of 42 months, reading progress was in Line with chronological age, which has not been the case previously with profoundly deaf children. With earlier implantation more common in present groups, and improved technology, there is every reason to be optimistic about the influence of cochlear implantation on the development of reading skills in deaf children.

Fifty-six patients were included. Associated HRCT scans were examined. Abnormalities of the cochlea, cochlear nerve, endolymphatic sac, endolymphatic duct, vestibule, and modiolus were noted. A pediatric neuroradiologist gave an opinion as to whether patients with anomalies seen with MRI but without associated HRCT would have been identified by HRCT.Results: Of the 112 temporal bones imaged with MRI, the following abnormalities were encountered: 32% (36/112) had abnormalities of the cochlear turns, 30% (34/112) had abnormal signal in the modiolus, 23% (26/112) had abnormal vestibulae, 16% (18/112) had abnormal endolymphatic ducts,15% (17/112) had abnormal endolymphatic sacs, 12% (13/112) had abnormalities of the cochlear nerves, 29% (17/56) had abnormalities of the brain. HRCT cannot directly evaluate the cochlear nerve. Available HRCT findings were combined with radiologic opinion and compared with MRI findings.

		"Background and objective: As shown by many studies, deaf children benefit considerably by cochlear implants (CI), concerning oral language and integration in mainstream schools. This had lead to the general, view of a good quality of life of these children. Unfortunately so far nearly no studies on quality of life, and specialty no studies on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children with cochlear implants, have been published. The present study with the objective for first, initial information on health-related quality of life of Austrian pupils with cochlear implants is a first step to fill this gap.Methods: Forty-four Austrian pupils, out of 65 candidates, age 8-16, with a hearing experience of at least 3 years with implants, and their parents were surveyed in the CI Center, Salzburg (cross sectional study). Basic medical and audiological data were available for all pupils. Because of reading comprehension difficulties 15 pupils were excluded. Parents and children were surveyed with the KINDLR, a generic instrument for health-related quality of life of children and adolescents. Main outcome measures were the HRQoL-total scores (mean, transformed to 100, standard deviation). In addition, 95% confidence intervals, effect sizes, t scores (one- and two-sided t-tests), rank order correlations and coefficients of determination were calculated.Results: The HRQoL-totat score of the children with CI (n = 18), age 8-12 was below the standard for hearing children (P < 0.001). It differed from the total score of the parent rating (P < 0.0001). The difference between the parent ratings of non-excluded and of excluded children (n = 12) was not significant. The total score of the adolescents (n = 11), age 13-16 was within the norm, with no significant difference between adolescent and parents. The total scores correlate with parent-child agreement in the ratings, with outcomes of audiological speech tests, length of time of deafness, and age at implantation.Conclusions: Children with CI experience a lower health-related quality of life, compared to hearing children, with a low parent-child agreement.

		"Toward a battery of behavioral and objective measures to achieve optimal cochlear implant stimulation levels in children",
		"Objectives: Children require audible and comfortable stimulation from their cochlear implants immediately after device activation. To accomplish this, a battery of objective measures may be needed that could include the electrically evoked stapedius reflex (ESR), compound action potential from the auditory nerve (ECAP), and/or auditory brain stem response (EABR). In the present study, the following specific research questions were asked: In children using cochlear implants, 1) Can the ECAP, EABR, and ESR be recorded at the time of cochlear implantation? 2) What is the feasibility of measuring the ECAP, EABR, and the ESR repeatedly without the use of sedation over the first year of implant use? 3) Do ECAP, EABR, and ESR thresholds or behavioral measures change over time? 4) What is the relation between ECAP, EABR, and ESR thresholds and behavioral measures of threshold and comfortably loud levels?Design: In 68 children, ECAP, EABR, and ESR responses as well as behavioral measures of stimulation threshold and maximum stimulation were recorded at regular intervals over the first year of implant use. In each child, responses were recorded to electrical pulses provided by three different electrodes along the implanted array. Visual inspections of the stapedius reflex (V-ESR) evoked by activation of the same three electrodes at the time of surgery were performed in an additional 20 children.Results: ECAP and EABR measures were obtained in more than 84% of electrodes tested and 89% of children tested both in the operating room at the time of implant surgery (OR) and after surgery in nonsedated children. ESRs were recorded by using immittance measures in more than 65% of electrodes tested and 67% of children tested by 3 mo of implant use, but this technique was less successful in the OR and during early stages of device use. V-ESRs and ECAP thresholds were higher in the OR than ESRs and ECAPs at postoperative recording times. EABR and ECAP thresholds did not significantly change over the first 6 and 12 mo of implant use, respectively, whereas ESR thresholds increased. Behavioral measures of threshold decreased over time, whereas maximum stimulation levels rose over time. Behavioral measures of threshold and loudness were highly correlated at all test times. ECAP, EABR, and behavioral measures were lower when evoked by an electrode at the apical end of the implanted array than by more basal electrodes. Behavioral thresholds could be predicted mainly by ECAP thresholds, whereas maximum stimulation levels could best be predicted by ESR thresholds; both were significantly affected by the age at implantation.Conclusions: A combination of nonbehavioral measures can aid in the determination of useful cochlear implant stimulation levels, particularly in young children and infants with limited auditory experience. These measures can be made in the operating room and can be repeated after surgery when needed. Correction factors to predict threshold stimulation levels should be based on ECAP thresholds or EABR thresholds if necessary. Correction factors should be made for at least one apical and mid-array electrode, should take into account the age of the child, and may have to be revised during the first year of implant use. Maximum stimulation levels may be best determined by using the ESR."+char(34)+"",

		"Localization ability with bimodal hearing aids and bilateral cochlear implants",
		"After successful cochlear implantation in one ear, some patients continue to use a hearing aid at the contralateral ear. They report an improved reception of speech, especially in noise, as well as a better perception of music when the hearing aid and cochlear implant are used in this bimodal combination. Some individuals in this bimodal patient group also report the impression of an improved localization ability. Similar experiences are reported by the group of bilateral cochlear implantees. In this study, a survey of 11 bimodally and 4 bilaterally equipped cochlear implant users was carried out to assess localization ability. Individuals in the bimodal implant group were all provided with the same type of hearing aid in the opposite ear, and subjects in the bilateral implant group used cochlear implants of the same manufacturer on each ear. Subjects adjusted the spot of a computer-controlled laser-pointer to the perceived direction of sound incidence in the frontal horizontal plane by rotating a trackball. Two subjects of the bimodal group who had substantial residual hearing showed localization ability in the bimodal configuration, whereas using each single device only the subject with better residual hearing was able to discriminate the side of sound origin. Five other subjects with more pronounced hearing loss displayed an ability for side discrimination through the use of bimodal aids, while four of them were already able to discriminate the side with a single device. Of the bilateral cochlear implant group one subject showed localization accuracy close to that of normal hearing subjects. This subject was also able to discriminate the side of sound origin using the first implanted device alone. The other three bilaterally equipped subjects showed limited localization ability using both devices. Among them one subject demonstrated a side-discrimination ability using only the first implanted device. (C) 2004 Acoustical Society of America."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective. The purpose of this study was to examine working memory for sequences of auditory and visual stimuli in prelingually deafened pediatric cochlear implant users with at least 4 yr of device experience.Design: Two groups of 8- and 9-yr-old children, 45 normal-hearing and 45 hearingimpaired users of cochlear implants, completed a novel working memory task requiring memory for sequences of either visual-spatial cues or visual-spatial cues paired with auditory signals. In each sequence, colored response buttons were illuminated either with or without simultaneous auditory presentation of verbal labels (color-names or digit-names). The child was required to reproduce each sequence by pressing the appropriate buttons on the response box. Sequence length was varied and a measure of memory span corresponding to the longest list length correctly reproduced under each set of presentation conditions was recorded. Additional children completed a modified task that eliminated the visual-spatial light cues but that still required reproduction of auditory color-name sequences using the same response box. Data from 37 pediatric cochlear implant users were collected using this modified task.Results: The cochlear implant group obtained shorter span scores on average than the normal-hearing group, regardless of presentation format. The normal-hearing children also demonstrated a larger "+char(34)+"redundancy gain"+char(34)+" than children in the cochlear implant groupthat is, the normal-hearing group displayed better memory for auditory-plus-lights sequences than for the lights-only sequences. Although the children with cochlear implants did not use the auditory signals as effectively as normal-hearing children when visual-spatial cues were also available, their performance on the modified memory task using only auditory cues showed that some of the children were capable of encoding auditory-only sequences at a level comparable with normalhearing children.Conclusions: The finding of smaller redundancy gains from the addition of auditory cues to visual-spatial sequences in the cochlear implant group as compared with the normal-hearing group demonstrates differences in encoding or rehearsal strategies between these two groups of children. Differences in memory span between the two groups even on a visual-spatial memory task suggests that atypical working memory development irrespective of input modality may be present in this clinical population."+char(34)+"",

The ability of these subjects to discriminate between stimulation on adjacent electrodes corresponding to each frequency band was also investigated, using a 4IFC procedure with random current level variations of between 0% and 60% of the dynamic range. Relative to normal-hearing listeners, speech information was, on average, significantly more reduced in the four frequency regions between 170 and 2680 Hz than in the region 2680-5744 Hz. There was a significant correlation between electrode discrimination ability (when the random level variation encompassed 20% or more of the dynamic range) and the amount of speech information perceived in the four frequency regions between 170 and 2680 Hz. There was no such correlation in the region 2680-5744 Hz, regardless of the extent of random level variation. These results indicate that speech information in the low to medium frequencies is more difficult for implantees to perceive, that this difficulty is correlated with the difficulty in discriminating electrode place in the presence of random loudness variations, and that fine spectral discrimination may be relatively more important in the vowel-formant regions than in higher frequency regions.

		"An important theme of longitudinal data analysis in the past two decades has been the development and use of explicit parametric models for the data's variance-covariance structure. A variety of these models have been proposed, of which most are second-order stationary. A few are flexible enough to accommodate nonstationarity, i.e., nonconstant variances and/or correlations that are not a function solely of elapsed time between measurements. We review five nonstationary models that we regard as most useful: (1) the unstructured covariance model, (2) unstructured antedependence models, (3) structured antedependence models, (4) autoregressive integrated moving average and similar models, and (5) random coefficients models. We evaluate the relative strengths and limitations of each model, emphasizing when it is inappropriate or unlikely to be useful. We present three examples to illustrate the fitting and comparison of the models and to demonstrate that nonstationary longitudinal data can be modeled effectively and, in some cases, quite parsimoniously. In these examples, the antedependence models generally prove to be superior and the random coefficients models prove to be inferior.

In an acute study with anaesthetised guinea pigs, DC was measured in four platinum intracochlear electrodes stimulated using a Nucleus(R) CI24M cochlear implant at moderate to high pulse rates (1200-14500 pulses/s) and stimulus intensities (0.2-1.75 mA at 26-200 mu s/phase), Both monopolar and bipolar stimulation modes were used, and the effects of shorting or combining a capacitor with shorting for charge recovery were investigated. Residual DC increased as a function of stimulus rate, stimulus intensity, and pulse width. DC was lower for monopolar than bipolar stimulation, and lower still with capacitively coupled monopolar stimulation. Our model suggests that residual DC is a consequence of Faradaic reactions which allow charge to leak through the electrode tissue interface. Such reactions and charge leakage are still present when capacitors are used to achieve charge recovery, but anodic and cathodic reactions are balanced in such a way that the net charge leakage is zero."+char(34)+"",

		"Identifying Cochlear Implant Channels with Poor Electrode-Neuron Interface: Partial Tripolar, Single-Channel Thresholds and Psychophysical Tuning Curves"+char(34)+"",
		"Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate the ability of a threshold measure, made with a restricted electrode configuration, to identify channels exhibiting relatively poor spatial selectivity. With a restricted electrode configuration, channel-to-channel variability in threshold may reflect variations in the interface between the electrodes and auditory neurons (i.e., nerve survival, electrode placement, and tissue impedance). These variations in the electrode-neuron interface should also be reflected in psychophysical tuning curve (PTC) measurements. Specifically, it is hypothesized that high single-channel thresholds obtained with the spatially focused partial tripolar (pTP) electrode configuration are predictive of wide or tip-shifted PTCs.Design: Data were collected from five cochlear implant listeners implanted with the HiRes90k cochlear implant (Advanced Bionics Corp., Sylmar, CA). Single-channel thresholds and most comfortable listening levels were obtained for stimuli that varied in presumed electrical field size by using the pTP configuration for which a fraction of current (sigma) from a center-active electrode returns through two neighboring electrodes and the remainder through a distant indifferent electrode. Forward-masked PTCs were obtained for channels with the highest, lowest, and median tripolar (sigma = 1 or 0.9) thresholds. The probe channel and level were fixed and presented with either the monopolar (sigma = 0) or a more focused pTP (sigma >= 0.55) configuration. The masker channel and level were varied, whereas the configuration was fixed to sigma = 0.5. A standard, three-interval, two-alternative forced choice procedure was used for thresholds and masked levels.Results: Single-channel threshold and variability in threshold across channels systematically increased as the compensating current, sigma, increased and the presumed electrical field became more focused. Across subjects, channels with the highest single-channel thresholds, when measured with a narrow, pTP stimulus, had significantly broader PTCs than the lowest threshold channels. In two subjects, the tips of the tuning curves were shifted away from the probe channel. Tuning curves were also wider for the monopolar probes than with pTP probes for both the highest and lowest threshold channels.Conclusions: These results suggest that single-channel thresholds measured with a restricted stimulus can be used to identify cochlear implant channels with poor spatial selectivity. Channels having wide or tip-shifted tuning characteristics would likely not deliver the appropriate spectral information to the intended auditory neurons, leading to suboptimal perception. As a clinical tool, quick identification of impaired channels could lead to patient-specific mapping strategies and result in improved speech and music perception."+char(34)+"",

Materials and Methods: Acoustic measurements during different drilling procedures were carried out on four human temporal bone preparations equipped with microphones attached to the round window. Special calibrations were carried out, which allowed determination of SPLs affecting the cochlea during the drilling procedure. Results: The highest SPLs measured on the cochlea were recorded when a still-intact endosteal membrane was touched by the burr. The SPL exceeded 130 dB and reached a level almost comparable with the situation when the ossicular chain is touched by a running burr. Conclusions. In the drilling procedure for a cochleostomy, the inner ear may be affected by very high SPLs, particularly if the endosteal membrane is left intact and comes into contact with the running burr. Of course, the resulting SPLs depend on the drilling speed and the size and characteristics of the burr (larger burrs cause higher SPLs); however, we are of the opinion that the cochlear function is at risk, anyway, if special precaution is not exercised. Even when working with reduced drilling speed, the surgeon should be aware of the high risk in the form of an acoustic trauma, which may endanger residual hearing. Recommendations in terms of "+char(34)+"soft surgery"+char(34)+" are given in the paper (e.g., the use of microhooks instead of a drill to remove the very last shell of bone covering the cochlea)."+char(34)+"",

		"Acoustic to electric pitch comparisons in cochlear implant subjects with residual hearing",
		"The aim of this study was to assess the frequency-position function resulting from electric stimulation of electrodes in cochlear implant subjects with significant residual hearing in their nonimplanted ear. Six cochlear implant users compared the pitch of the auditory sensation produced by stimulation of an intracochlear electrode to the pitch of acoustic pure tones presented to their contralateral nonimplanted ear. Subjects were implanted with different Clarion (R) electrode arrays, designed to lie close to the inner wall of the cochlea. High-resolution radiographs were used to determine the electrode positions in the cochlea. Four out of six subjects presented electrode insertions deeper than 450 degrees. We used a two-interval (one acoustic, one electric), twoalternative forced choice protocol (21-2AFC), asking the subject to indicate which stimulus sounded the highest in pitch. Pure tones were used as acoustic stimuli. Electric stimuli consisted of trains of biphasic pulses presented at relatively high rates [higher than 700 pulses per second (pps)]. First, all electric stimuli were balanced in loudness across electrodes. Second, acoustic pure tones, chosen to approximate roughly the pitch sensation produced by each electrode, were balanced in loudness to electric stimuli. When electrode insertion lengths were used to describe electrode positions, the pitch sensations produced by electric stimulation were found to be more than two octaves lower than predicted by Greenwood's frequency position function. When insertion angles were used to describe electrode positions, the pitch sensations were found about one octave lower than the frequency position function of a normal ear. The difference found between both descriptions is because of the fact that these electrode arrays were designed to lie close to the modiolus. As a consequence, the site of excitation produced at the level of the organ of Corti corresponds to a longer length than the electrode insertion length, which is used in Greenwood's function. Although exact measurements of the round window position as well as the length of the cochlea could explain the remaining one octave difference found when insertion angles were used, physiological phenomena (e.g., stimulation of the spiral ganglion cells) could also create this difference. From these data, analysis filters could be determined in sound coding strategies to match the pitch percepts elicited by electrode stimulation. This step might be of main importance for music perception and for the fitting of bilateral cochlear implants."+char(34)+"",

		"Background: In the context of the established finding that theory-of-mind (ToM) growth is seriously delayed in late-signing deaf children, and some evidence of equivalent delays in those learning speech with conventional hearing aids, this study's novel contribution was to explore ToM development in deaf children with cochlear implants. Implants can substantially boost auditory acuity and rates of language growth. Despite the implant, there are often problems socialising with hearing peers and some language difficulties, lending special theoretical interest to the present comparative design. Methods: A total of 52 children aged 4 to 12 years took a battery of false belief tests of ToM. There were 26 oral deaf children, half with implants and half with hearing aids, evenly divided between oral-only versus sign-plus-oral schools. Comparison groups of age-matched high06/ 09/2020, 11:00 AM functioning children with autism and younger hearing children were also included. Results: No significant ToM differences emerged between deaf children with implants and those with hearing aids, nor between those in oral-only versus sign-plus-oral schools. Nor did the deaf children perform any better on the ToM tasks than their age peers with autism. Hearing preschoolers scored significantly higher than all other groups. For the deaf and the autistic children, as well as the preschoolers, rate of language development and verbal maturity significantly predicted variability in ToM, over and above chronological age. Conclusions: The finding that deaf children with cochlear implants are as delayed in ToM development as children with autism and their deaf peers with hearing aids or late sign language highlights the likely significance of peer interaction and early fluent communication with peers and family, whether in sign or in speech, in order to optimally facilitate the growth of social cognition and language."+char(34)+"",

		"The Relationship Between Insertion Angles, Default Frequency Allocations, and Spiral Ganglion Place Pitch in Cochlear Implants"+char(34)+"",
		"Objectives: Commercially available cochlear implant systems attempt to deliver frequency information going down to a few hundred Hertz, but the electrode arrays are not designed to reach the most apical regions of the cochlea, which correspond to these low frequencies. This may cause a mismatch between the frequencies presented by a cochlear implant electrode array and the frequencies represented at the corresponding location in a normal-hearing cochlea. In the following study, the mismatch between the frequency presented at a given cochlear angle and the frequency expected by an acoustic hearing ear at the corresponding angle is examined for the cochlear implant systems that are most commonly used in the United States.Design: The angular insertion of each of the electrodes on four different electrode arrays (MED-EL Standard, MED-EL Flex28, Advanced Bionics HiFocus 1J, and Cochlear Contour Advance) was estimated from X-ray. For the angular location of each electrode on each electrode array, the predicted spiral ganglion frequency was estimated. The predicted spiral ganglion frequency was compared with the center frequency provided by the corresponding electrode using the manufacturer's default frequency-to-electrode allocation.Results: Differences across devices were observed for the place of stimulation for frequencies below 650 Hz. Longer electrode arrays (i.e., the MED-EL Standard and Flex28) demonstrated smaller deviations from the spiral ganglion map than the other electrode arrays. For insertion angles up to approximately 270 degrees, the frequencies presented at a given location were typically approximately an octave below what would be expected by a spiral ganglion frequency map, while the deviations were larger for angles deeper than 270 degrees. For frequencies above 650 Hz, the frequency to angle relationship was consistent across all four electrode models.Conclusions: A mismatch was observed between the predicted frequency and the default frequency provided by every electrode on all electrode arrays. The mismatch can be reduced by changing the default frequency allocations, inserting electrodes deeper into the cochlea, or allowing cochlear implant users to adapt to the mismatch. Further studies are required to fully assess the clinical significance of the frequency mismatch."+char(34)+"",

		"Purpose: In this article, the authors sought to determine whether the precise age of implantation (AOI) remains an important predictor of spoken language outcomes in later childhood for those who received a cochlear implant (CI) between 12 and 38 months of age. Relative advantages of receiving a bilateral CI after age 4.5 years, better pre-CI-aided hearing, and longer CI experience were also examined.Method: Sixty children participated in a prospective longitudinal study of outcomes at 4.5 and 10.5 years of age. Twenty-nine children received a sequential second CI. Test scores were compared with normative samples of hearing age mates, and predictors of outcomes were identified.Results: Standard scores on language tests at 10.5 years of age remained significantly correlated with age of first cochlear implantation. Scores were not associated with receipt of a second, sequentially acquired CI. Significantly higher scores were achieved for vocabulary as compared with overall language, a finding not evident when the children were tested at younger ages.Conclusion: Age-appropriate spoken language skills continued to be more likely with younger AOI, even after an average of 8.6 years of additional CI use.

		"Tinnitus and cochlear implantation",
		"Tinnitus is a common experience, but there is very marked heterogeneity of aetiology, perception and the extent of distress among individuals who experience tinnitus. In view of this, a modern approach to tinnitus should consider homogeneous groups of individuals. This review considers tinnitus experiences in patients undergoing cochlear implantation, this being of interest because the prevalence of tinnitus in this patient group prior to surgery may shed some light on the link between cochlear dysfunction and tinnitus. Second, any change in tinnitus experience as a result of electrode placement surgery or cochlear implant activation has relevance for patient counselling and informed consent. Finally, in recent tinnitus retraining therapy literature there has been the suggestion that unilateral sound therapy for tinnitus patients may set up an unhelpful asymmetry of input to the auditory system, with possible exacerbation of contralateral tinnitus. Unilateral cochlaer implant use represents the most dramatic asymmetry possible and hence is it test of that hypothesis. Relevant papers (n =32) were identified from literature databases. The standard of reporting tinnitus results was inconsistent. Tinnitus is experienced by up to 86% of adult cochlear implant candidates, but is not universal and is only troublesome in a small proportion (reported its 27% in one study). Electrode insertion may induce tinnitus in a small (up to 4%) number of patients, bill this is rare. Cochlear implant device use is associated with reduction of tinnitus intensity and awareness in up to 86% of patients, and rarely with exacerbation (up to 9%). There are some indications in the literature that the more complex the simulation strategy, the larger that effect. Specifically, unilateral cochlear implant use was generally associated with reduction of contralateral tinnitus (in up to 67% of individuals) rather than exacerbation, and so the assertion that unilateral sound therapy for tinnitus is contraindicated is not proven."+char(34)+"",

Results from a group of 89 unimplanted subjects provided cross-sectional data which suggested that profoundly deaf children without implants, on average, could only be expected to make 5 months of expressive language growth in one year. Twenty-three children who received cochlear implants made up the second group of subjects and were administered the RDLS at three intervals: preimplant, 6-, and 12-months postimplant. The scores obtained at the post-implant intervals were then compared to scores that would be predicted on the basis of maturation alone, without the implant (these predictions were formulated based on the data obtained from the unimplanted subjects). At the 12-month postimplant interval, the observed mean language score was significantly higher than the predicted score. Although the mean group data were extremely encouraging, wide inter-subject variability was observed. Although the implant subjects, as a group, were substantially delayed compared with their normal hearing peers, their rate of language growth was found to match that of hearing peers, following implantation. Thus, the gap between chronological age and language age, which normally widens over time in deaf children, remained constant. Preliminary analyses over the first 2.5 years post-implant are consistent with this trend. These results suggest that early implantation (before age 3) might be beneficial to profoundly deaf children because the language delays at the time of implantation would be much smaller."+char(34)+"",

The goal of this study was to determine whether age at implantation has a significant, lasting impact on speech perception, language, and reading performance for children with prelingual hearing loss.Design: A linear mixedmodel framework was used to determine the effect of age at implantation on speech perception, language, and reading abilities in 83 children with prelingual hearing loss who received cochlear implants by the age of 4 years. The children were divided into two groups based on their age at implantation: (1) under 2 years of age and (2) between 2 and 3.9 years of age. Differences in modelspecified mean scores between groups were compared at annual intervals from 5 to 13 years of age for speech perception, and 7 to 11 years of age for language and reading.Results: After controlling for communication mode, device configuration, and preoperative pure-tone average, there was no significant effect of age at implantation for receptive language by 8 years of age, expressive language by 10 years of age, reading by 7 years of age. In terms of speech-perception outcomes, significance varied between 7 and 13 years of age, with no significant difference in speech-perception scores between groups at ages 7, 11, and 13 years. Children who used oral communication (OC) demonstrated significantly higher speech-perception scores than children who used total communication (TC). OC users tended to have higher expressive language scores than TC users, although this did not reach significance. There was no significant difference between OC and TC users for receptive language or reading scores.Conclusions: Speech perception, language, and reading performance continue to improve over time for children implanted before 4 years of age. The present results indicate that the effect of age at implantation diminishes with time, particularly for higher-order skills such as language and reading. Some children who receive cochlear implants after the age of 2 years have the capacity to approximate the language and reading skills of their earlierimplanted peers, suggesting that additional factors may moderate the influence of age at implantation on outcomes over time."+char(34)+"",

		"Cochlear Implantation in Adults With Asymmetric Hearing Loss",
		"Objective: Bilateral severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss is a standard criterion for cochlear implantation. Increasingly, patients are implanted in one ear and continue to use a hearing aid in the nonimplanted ear to improve abilities such as sound localization and speech understanding in noise. Patients with severe to profound hearing loss in one ear and a more moderate hearing loss in the other ear (i.e., asymmetric hearing) are not typically considered candidates for cochlear implantation. Amplification in the poorer ear is often unsuccessful because of limited benefit, restricting the patient to unilateral listening from the better ear alone. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with asymmetric hearing loss could benefit from cochlear implantation in the poorer ear with continued use of a hearing aid in the better ear.Design: Ten adults with asymmetric hearing between ears participated. In the poorer ear, all participants met cochlear implant candidacy guidelines; seven had postlingual onset, and three had pre/perilingual onset of severe to profound hearing loss. All had open-set speech recognition in the better-hearing ear. Assessment measures included word and sentence recognition in quiet, sentence recognition in fixed noise (four-talker babble) and in diffuse restaurant noise using an adaptive procedure, localization of word stimuli, and a hearing handicap scale. Participants were evaluated preimplant with hearing aids and postimplant with the implant alone, the hearing aid alone in the better ear, and bimodally (the implant and hearing aid in combination). Postlingual participants were evaluated at 6 mo postimplant, and pre/perilingual participants were evaluated at 6 and 12 mo postimplant. Data analysis compared the following results: (1) the poorer-hearing ear preimplant (with hearing aid) and postimplant (with cochlear implant); (2) the device(s) used for everyday listening pre- and postimplant; and (3) the hearing aidalone and bimodal listening conditions postimplant.Results: The postlingual participants showed significant improvements in speech recognition after 6 mo cochlear implant use in the poorer ear. Five postlingual participants had a bimodal advantage over the hearing aid-alone condition on at least one test measure. On average, the postlingual participants had significantly improved localization with bimodal input compared with the hearing aid-alone. Only one pre/perilingual participant had open-set speech recognition with the cochlear implant. This participant had better hearing than the other two pre/perilingual participants in both the poorer and better ear. Localization abilities were not significantly different between the bimodal and hearing aid-alone conditions for the pre/perilingual participants. Mean hearing handicap ratings improved postimplant for all participants indicating perceived benefit in everyday life with the addition of the cochlear implant.Conclusions: Patients with asymmetric hearing loss who are not typical cochlear implant candidates can benefit from using a cochlear implant in the poorer ear with continued use of a hearing aid in the better ear. For this group of 10, the 7 postlingually deafened participants showed greater benefits with the cochlear implant than the pre/perilingual participants; however, further study is needed to determine maximum benefit for those with early onset of hearing loss."+char(34)+"",

		"Cochlear implants provide hearing by electrically stimulating the auditory nerve. Implant function can be hindered by device design variables, including electrode size and electrode-to-nerve distance, and cochlear environment variables, including the degeneration of the auditory nerve following hair cell loss. We have developed a dual-component cochlear implant coating to improve both the electrical function of the implant and the biological stability of the inner ear, thereby facilitating the long-term perception of sound through a cochlear implant. This coating is a combination of an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-functionalized alginate hydrogel and the conducting polymer poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). Both in vitro and in vivo assays on the effects of these electrode coatings demonstrated improvements in device performance. We found that the coating reduced electrode impedance, improved charge delivery, and locally released significant levels of a trophic factor into cochlear fluids. This coating is non-cytotoxic, clinically relevant, and has the potential to significantly improve the cochlear implant user's experience. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."+char(34)+"",

Sections containing the round window membrane (RWM) and surrounding cochlear structures were stained, digitized, and imported into a general purpose three-dimensional rendering and analysis software program (Amira, version 4.1). Three-dimensional models of the RWM, basilar membrane, osseous spiral lamina, spiral ligament, cochlear aqueduct, inferior cochlea vein, scala media, ductus reuniens, scala vestibuli, scala tympani, and surrounding bone were generated.

Investigational review board approval was obtained.RESULTS: Twenty of 26 (77%) ears demonstrated cochlear aperture atresia. Four of these ears were evaluated with MR imaging and were found to lack a cochlear nerve. Twenty-one of 26 (81%) cochlea had some form of dysplasia. Six of 26 (23%) round windows were aplastic. Three of 26 (12%) round windows were hypoplastic. Twenty-one of 26 (81%) oval windows were atretic or aplastic. Fifteen of 26 (58%) vestibules were hypoplastic or dysplastic. There were 5 of 26 (19%) enlarged vestibular aqueducts. Twelve of 26 (46%) vestibular aqueducts had an anomalous course. All cases demonstrated absent semicircular canals. Twenty-three of 26 (88%) facial nerve canals had an anomalous course. Four of 26 (15%) tympanic segments were prolapsed. Three of 26 (12%) temporal bones had an anomalous emissary vein referred to as a petrosquamosal sinus. Twenty-one of 26 (81%) middle ear cavities were small. Twenty-three of 26 (93%) ossicles were dysplastic with ankylosis. Three of 26 (12%) internal auditory canals were small.CONCLUSION: The CT findings that correlate to the anomalies of CHARGE syndrome affect conductive as well as sensorineural hearing. Stenosis of the aperture for the cochlear nerve aperture on CT is suggestive of hypoplasia or absence of the cochlear nerve, which has been demonstrated in some cases by MR. Absence of the cochlear nerve would be a contraindication to cochlear implantation."+char(34)+"",

In addition, as a population, our cohort had a mean postoperative con sonant-nucleusconsonant word score of 41.8%, which was statistically the same as that predicted by the University of Iowa formula (43.6%).Conclusions: The postoperative performance of cochlear implant patients is most closely correlated with duration of deafness. However, our results indicate that this measure may not be ear specific and is more reflective of the total auditory receptivity of the patient.

		"Cochlear implantation in patients with auditory neuropathy of varied etiologies",
		"Objectives/Hypothesis. Auditory neuropathy is a relatively recently described pattern of hearing loss characterized by preservation of outer hair cell function despite absent brainstem auditory evoked responses. Intact outer hair cell function is demonstrated by the presence of otoacoustic emissions and/or a measurable cochlear microphonic on electrocochleography, whereas no synchronous neural activity (absent action potentials) is seen on acoustically evoked brainstem auditory evoked response testing. The study reviews the authors' experience with six patients diagnosed with auditory neuropathy, four of whom have undergone cochlear implantation. Materials and Methods. A retrospective review of all medical and audiological charts at the University of Virginia Hospitals (Charlottesville, VA) was performed to identify patients who have undergone cochlear implantation or have been diagnosed with auditory neuropathy, or both. Results. Six patients with hearing loss attributable to auditory neuropathy were identified, four of whom have undergone cochlear implantation. Causes varied, including congenital, infectious, and idiopathic origins. Adults demonstrated subjective auditory perception on promontory stimulation, whereas no repeatable brainstem auditory evoked response waveforms could be demonstrated on pediatric promontory stimulation testing. Patients with implants demonstrated implant-evoked brainstem auditory evoked responses and improved audiological performance. Conclusions: The six cases presented in the study represent varied causes and, probably, varied sites of lesions of auditory neuropathy. Promontory stimulation has been valuable, particularly in adults. Cochlear implantation allows the opportunity to provide a supraphysiological electrical stimulation to the auditory nerve, with the hope of reintroducing synchronous neural activity. Greater confidence and enthusiasm for cochlear implantation in appropriately selected patients with auditory neuropathy are gained through experience with such diverse cases."+char(34)+"",

		"Neurocognitive factors in sensory restoration of early deafness: a connectome model",
		"Progress in biomedical technology (cochlear, vestibular, and retinal implants) has led to remarkable success in neurosensory restoration, particularly in the auditory system. However, outcomes vary considerably, even after accounting for comorbidity-for example, after cochlear implantation, some deaf children develop spoken language skills approaching those of their hearing peers, whereas other children fail to do so. Here, we review evidence that auditory deprivation has widespread effects on brain development, affecting the capacity to process information beyond the auditory system. After sensory loss and deafness, the brain's effective connectivity is altered within the auditory system, between sensory systems, and between the auditory system and centres serving higher order neurocognitive functions. As a result, congenital sensory loss could be thought of as a connectome disease, with interindividual variability in the brain's adaptation to sensory loss underpinning much of the observed variation in outcome of cochlear implantation. Different executive functions, sequential processing, and concept formation are at particular risk in deaf children. A battery of clinical tests can allow early identification of neurocognitive risk factors. Intervention strategies that address these impairments with a personalised approach, taking interindividual variations into account, will further improve outcomes."+char(34)+"",

		"Objectives: Recently, open-set speech recognition performance has been observed with electric stimulation of the brainstem in some nontumor (NT) patients. These outcomes require that we reevaluate the criteria for patient selection and the rationale for expanding the application for the auditory brainstem implant (ABI) to NT adult patients with profound hearing loss. This study presents results from up to 10 years in adults, with analysis based on cause.Materials and Methods: In our Department, from April 1997 to September 2007, ABIs have been implanted in 112 patients (83 adults and 29 children) with tumor (T) and NT disorders. Of the 112 patients, 15 have previously had a cochlear implant elsewhere with no sound detection. This article presents speech recognition results from the 80 patients (32 neurofibromatosis type 2 and 48 NT) who had achieved at least 1- year follow-up. The retrosigmoid approach was used in all NT patients, and the retrosigmoidtransmeatal approach was used in all T patients.Results: All patients had a functioning implantation, and no complications were observed during the operation, activation, or long-term use of the ABI. At the most recent follow-up, NT adults scored from 10 to 100% in open-set speech perception tests (average, 59%), and T patients scored from 5 to 31% (average, 10%). The differences between these results are statistically significant (p = 0.0007). The best performance was observed in patients who lost their nerve VIII from head trauma or severe ossification. Lowest performance (although still highly beneficial to the patient) was observed in patients with neurologic disorders, neuropathy, and cochlear malformations.Conclusion: Our experience clearly indicates that the ABI is an effective tool for hearing rehabilitation in patients with profound hearing loss who cannot be fitted with cochlear implants."+char(34)+"",

However, in comparison with the extensive literature on speech, language, and communication outcomes following pediatric implantation in children without complex needs, the available literature for this special group of children is relatively sparse. This article reviews the available research on outcomes, grouping studies according to the nature of the additional disabilities and specific etiologies of deafness. The methodological problems relating to outcome research in this field are outlined, followed by some tentative conclusions drawn from the literature base while bearing these problems in mind. The remainder of the article focuses on the challenges for clinical practice, from a psychological perspective, of implanting deaf children with complex needs. Two groups of children are considered, those whose additional disabilities have been identified prior to implantation and those whose difficulties become apparent at some point afterward, sometimes many years later.

		"Auditory neuropathy: An update",
		"Objectives: To describe the round window electrocochleography (RWECochG) and electric auditory brainstem responses (EABR) in ears affected by auditory neuropathy (AN), and to determine if these electrophysiological tests can predict the outcome following cochlear implant surgery.Methods: A longitudinal study of all pediatric cochlear implant patients between 1994 and 2005 was undertaken. Speech perception outcomes after cochlear implantation and electrophysiological data were collected prospectively and analyzed. Some otoacoustic emissions (OAE) data were collected retrospectively during the neonatal period. All subjects were tested using round window electrocochleography (RWEcochG), auditory brainstem responses (ABR), and implant-evoked electric auditory brainstem responses (EABR). The auditory neuropathy (AN) group consisted of 39 children (78 ears) which had present OAE and absent or grossly abnormal ABR (a broad N1 component only).Results: All 78 ears from the 39 AN children showed large cochlear microphonics (CM) and an abnormal positive potential (APP) using RW ECochG. A further 21 children showed large CM and APP but had not been tested for OAE. In total, 60 children were discovered to have APP among 435 pediatric patients who received a cochlear implant. Electrically evoked ABR (EABR) from the implanted ear were normal in 45 and abnormal in 15. 46 age matched patients without large CM and APP were used as a control group. Two year postimplant scores (Melbourne categories) were: 6.27 (APP and normal EABR), 2.25 (APP and abnormal EABR) and 5.37 (control group). Mann-Whitney U Test for nonparametric data was used to test for significant difference at significance level p < 0.005 (two tailed). The APP ears which provided normal EABR had significantly better outcomes after cochlear implantation than APP ears which had abnormal EABR. Furthermore, the APP ears which provided normal EABR performed significantly better after cochlear implant surgery than the control group of patients with no OAE, appropriate ABR results and normal EABR absent or abnormal ABR may not indicate a pathological condition affecting the auditory nerve or synapse but only survival of outer hair cells despite extensive loss of inner hair cells. (Ear & Hearing 2007;28;102S-106S) For many years clinicians have been aware that a few hearing impaired children have a disproportionate loss of speech perception leading to a poor performance using conventional hearing aids. The term "+char(34)+"auditory neuropathy"+char(34)+" was originally coined in 1995 (Sininger, Hood, & Starr, 1995) after the first longitudinal study of 10 subjects who were discovered to have absent or grossly abnormal auditory brainstem. responses (ABR), but present otoacoustic emissions (OAE). These findings led to the concept that the dysfunction primarily affected the neural auditory pathway (Starr, Picton, Sininger, et al., 1996); however, this concept failed to account for the unexpectedly good performance of most of these ears using a cochlear implant (Miyamoto, Kirk, Renshaw, et al., 1999; Trautwein, Sininger, & Nelson, 2000; Shallop, Peterson, Facer, et al., 2001; Gibson & Sanli, 2002; Madden, Hilbert, Rutter, et al., 2002; Buss, Labadie, Brown, Grosset, et al., 2002; Mason, De Michelle, & Stevens, 2003). This paper reviews the electrophysiological findings obtained from children affected by AN. OAE are assumed to be derived from the motor activity of outer hair cells (OHC) and do not appear to depend in any important way of the functioning of inner hair cells (IHC) (Mills, 2006). IHC are not connected to the overlying tectorial membrane and cannot exert an effective force back on the organ of Corti and cannot be a significant source of OAE (Trautwein, Hofstetter, Wang, et al., 1996). Abnormal positive potentials (APP) are an early positive summating potential (SP) with respect to an active electrode placed in the round window niche (O'Leary, Mitchell, Gibson, et al., 2000). The APP or early positive SP is probably generated by a slight asymmetry of production of CM.Conclusions: Ears affected by AN provide large CM and APP on RW ECochG. The presence of normal EABR may indicate a significantly better outcome after cochlear implant surgery than for those APP ears which had abnormal or absent EABR. Based on these findings it is suggested that the presence of APP and/ or OAE in 75% of the ears which have absent or abnormal ABR may not indicate a pathological condition affecting the auditory nerve or synapse but only survival of outer hair cells despite extensive loss of inner hair cells."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: To report the surgical aspects of cochlear implantation in malformed cochlea.Setting: Tertiary care center.Study Design: Retrospective case review.Methods: Between November 1997 and October 2004, 20 patients with inner ear malformations were implanted in our department. The age range was between 2 and 37 years (average, 8.8 yr). The anomalies were classified according to Sennaroglu and Saatci classification. There were two patients with common cavity deformity, four cases of incomplete partition (IP) type I (cystic cochleovestibular malformation), four cases of IP type II (classical Mondini's deformity), nine patients with large vestibular aqueduct (LVA) syndrome, and one patient with X-linked deafness.Results: Standard transmastoid facial recess approach was used in 17 patients (three patients with IP I, four patients with IP II, and nine patients with LVA syndrome). In the remaining patient with IP I, because of the dehiscent and anteriorly located facial nerve, the surgical approach had to be modified, and an anteroposterior approach was used. After elevating the tympanomeatal flap, the electrode was inserted through the ear canal and then transferred to the mastoid through a full-length cut produced in the ear canal. The flap then returned to its place. In the patients with common cavity deformity, the electrode was inserted by the transmastoid labyrinthotomy approach. Facial nerve had an abnormal course in four patients, but no patient had facial weakness postoperatively. Cerebrospinal fluid gusher was encountered in four patients, whereas oozing was present in five patients. It seems that a slightly larger cochleostomy may reduce postoperative rhinorrhea. The patient with common cavity deformity showed abnormal vestibular stimulation which decreased and was totally abolished during a 3-month period.Conclusion: Based on these findings, cochlear implantation is surgically feasible in patients with common cavity, IP types I and II, and LVA. The surgeon should be ready to make modifications in the surgical approach because of the abnormal course of the facial nerve and be ready to produce special precautions to cerebrospinal fluid gusher."+char(34)+"",

Neurotrophic factor therapy may therefore provide similar protective effects in humans, resulting in improved speech perception outcomes among cochlear implant patients.

The recognition accuracy of the two groups was compared for three musical genre: classical, country, and pop. Recognition accuracy was correlated with speech recognition scores, cognitive measures, and demographic measures, including musical background.Results: Cochlear implant recipients were significantly less accurate in recognition of previously familiar (known before hearing loss) musical excerpts than normal-hearing adults (p < 0.001) for all three genre. Implant recipients were most accurate in the recognition of country items and least accurate in the recognition of classical items. There were no significant differences among implant recipients due to implant type (Nucleus, Clarion, or Ineraid), or programming strategy (SPEAK, CIS, or ACE). For cochlear implant recipients, correlations between melody recognition and other measures were moderate to weak in strength; those with statistically significant correlations included age at time of testing (negatively correlated), performance on selected speech perception tests, and the amount of focused music listening following implantation.Conclusions: Current-day cochlear implants are not effective in transmitting several key structural features (i.e., pitch, harmony, timbral blends) of music essential to open-set recognition of well-known musical selections. Consequently, implant recipients must rely on extracting those musical features most accessible through the implant, such as song lyrics or a characteristic rhythm pattern, to identify the sorts of musical selections heard in everyday life."+char(34)+"",

		"The latest-generation cochlear implant devices provide many deaf patients with good speech recognition in quiet listening conditions. However, speech recognition deteriorates rapidly as the level of background noise increases. Previous studies have shown that, for cochlear implant users, the absence of fine spectro-temporal cries may contribute to poorer performance in noise, especially Mien the noise is dynamic (e.g., competing speaker or modulated noise). Here we report on sentence recognition by cochlear implant users and by normal-hearing subjects listening to an acoustic simulation of a cochlear implant, in the presence of stead), or square-wave modulated speech-shaped noise. Implant users were tested using their everyday, clinically assigned speech processors. In the acoustic simulation, normal-hearing listeners were tested for different degrees of spectral resolution (16, eight, or four channels) and spectral smearing (carrier filter slopes of -24 or -6 dB/octave). For Modulated noise, normal-hearing listeners experienced significant release from masking when the original, unprocessed speech was presented (which preserved the spectro-temporal fine structure), while cochlear implant users experienced no release from masking. As the spectral resolution was reduced, normal-hearing listeners release from masking gradually diminished. Release from masking was further reduced as the degree of spectral smearing increased. Interestingly, the mean speech recognition thresholds of implant users were very close to those of normal-hearing subjects listening to four-channel spectrally smeared noise-band speech. Also, the best cochlear implant listeners performed like normal-hearing subjects listening to eight- to 16-channel spectrally smeared noiseband speech. These findings Suggest that implant users' susceptibility to noise may be caused by the reduced spectral resolution and the high degree of spectral smearing associated with channel interaction. Efforts to improve the effective number of spectral channels as well as reduce channel interactions May improve implant performance in noise, especially for temporally modulated noise."+char(34)+"",

		"Auditory prostheses can partially restore speech comprehension when hearing fails. Sound coding with current prostheses is based on electrical stimulation of auditory neurons and has limited frequency resolution due to broad current spread within the cochlea. In contrast, optical stimulation can be spatially confined, which may improve frequency resolution. Here, we used animal models to characterize optogenetic stimulation, which is the optical stimulation of neurons genetically engineered to express the light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). Optogenetic stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) activated the auditory pathway, as demonstrated by recordings of single neuron and neuronal population responses. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of SGNs restored auditory activity in deaf mice. Approximation of the spatial spread of cochlear excitation by recording local field potentials (LFPs) in the inferior colliculus in response to suprathreshold optical, acoustic, and electrical stimuli indicated that optogenetic stimulation achieves better frequency resolution than monopolar electrical stimulation. Virus-mediated expression of a ChR2 variant with greater light sensitivity in SGNs reduced the amount of light required for responses and allowed neuronal spiking following stimulation up to 60 Hz. Our study demonstrates a strategy for optogenetic stimulation of the auditory pathway in rodents and lays the groundwork for future applications of cochlear optogenetics in auditory research and prosthetics."+char(34)+"",

This pathology will affect the biophysical processes involved in action potential generation and propagation to an electrical stimulus via a cochlear implant. We measured the response properties of ANs, with particular reference to their refractory behaviour, in normal, short- (9 weeks) and long-term (> 52 weeks) deafened rats. AN loss was moderate in the short-term and severe in the long-term deafened animals. AN activity was elicited using a brief electrical stimulus delivered via a bipolar electrode array implanted into the cochlea. The general response properties of ANs recorded from deafened cochleae were similar to those observed in normal cochleae, i.e. a monotonic increase in the probability of firing and a decrease in response latency and temporal jitter with increasing stimulus intensity. However, the absolute refractory period was significantly prolonged in animals deaf for > 12 months (P = 0.0026). Deafened animals also exhibited a highly significant increase in threshold compared with normal controls (P < 0.001).

		"Viral Causes of Hearing Loss: A Review for Hearing Health Professionals",
		"A number of viral infections can cause hearing loss. Hearing loss induced by these viruses can be congenital or acquired, unilateral or bilateral. Certain viral infections can directly damage inner ear structures, others can induce inflammatory responses which then cause this damage, and still others can increase susceptibility or bacterial or fungal infection, leading to hearing loss. Typically, virusinduced hearing loss is sensorineural, although conductive and mixed hearing losses can be seen following infection with certain viruses. Occasionally, recovery of hearing after these infections can occur spontaneously. Most importantly, some of these viral infections can be prevented or treated. For many of these viruses, guidelines for their treatment or prevention have recently been revised. In this review, we outline many of the viruses that cause hearing loss, their epidemiology, course, prevention, and treatment."+char(34)+"",

		"Clinical Evaluation of Signal-to-Noise Ratio-Based Noise Reduction in Nucleus (R) Cochlear Implant Recipients",
		"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether a real-time noise reduction algorithm provided speech perception benefit for Cochlear (TM) Nucleus (R) cochlear implant recipients in the laboratory.Design: The noise reduction algorithm attenuated masker-dominated channels. It estimated the signal-to-noise ratio of each channel on a short-term basis from a single microphone input, using a recursive minimum statistics method. In this clinical evaluation, the algorithm was implemented in two programs (noise reduction programs 1 [NR1] and 2 [NR2]), which differed in their level of noise reduction. These programs used advanced combination encoder (ACE T) channel selection and were compared with ACE without noise reduction in 13 experienced cochlear implant subjects. An adaptive speech reception threshold (SRT) test provided the signal-to-noise ratio for 50% sentence intelligibility in three different types of noises: speech-weighted, cocktail party, and street-side city noise.Results: In all three noise types, mean SRTs for both NR programs were significantly better than those for ACE. The greatest improvement occurred for speech-weighted noise; the SRT benefit over ACE was 1.77 dB for NR1 and 2.14 dB for NR2. There were no significant differences in speech perception scores between the two NR programs. Subjects reported no degradation in sound quality with the experimental programs.Conclusions: The noise reduction algorithm was successful in improving sentence perception in speech-weighted noise, as well as in more dynamic types of background noise. The algorithm is currently being trialed in a behind-theear processor for take-home use."+char(34)+"",

		"Objectives: Determine prevalence and types of vestibular impairments in sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in a large population of pediatric candidates for cochlear implants. Evaluate impact of cochlear implants on vestibular function.Study design: Retrospective and prospective study.Methods: Children with profound SNHL (n = 224) underwent complete vestibular testing (clinical vestibular examination, bicaloric test, earth vertical axis rotation, off vertical. axis rotation and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials) before cochlear implant. Changes in vestibular responses were measured after implants in 89 of these patients.Results: In the SNHL population only 50% had normal bilateral vestibular function, while 20% had bilateral complete areflexia, 22.5% partial asymmetrical hypoexcitability and 7.5% partial symmetrical hypoexcitability.In the 71/89 follow-up patients showing vestibular responses prior to implant, 51 (71%) had changes in vestibular function including 7 (10%) who acquired ipsilateral areflexia. Others developed ipsilateral hypo- or hyperexcitability. Vestibular modifications occurred during the 3 months after surgery and were not clearly associated with clinical. signs except for ipsilateral areflexia cases. In long-term follow-up, two of the 7 patients with ipsilateral areflexia partially recovered vestibular function. Conclusion: Since half of pediatric cochlear implant candidates have vestibular deficits and 51% of implants induce modifications of existing vestibular function, each implant should be preceded by canal and otolith functional tests to assure that the least functional. vestibule is implanted. The tests provide baselines for follow-up monitoring of subsequent losses and recovery. This could be easily implemented with a clinical vestibular examination including the head thrust test associated with a bicaloric test and vestibular-evoked-myogenic-potentials.

		"Objective. To evaluate the additional perceptual benefit provided to children through the use of two cochlear implants in comparison to one after 6 to 13 mo experience with sequential bilateral implants.Design: A second cochlear implant was received by 11 children. The principal selection criteria were being age 4 to 15 yr with a bilateral profound hearing loss and being a consistent user of a first implant with a commitment to use of a second implant. Horizontal localization was assessed by using pink noise bursts presented from a 180 degrees, eight-loudspeaker array. Speech perception was assessed by using a four-alternative forced-choice spondee test, with speech presented from in front and adaptive background noise presented from 90 degrees to the left or right. Both tests were completed in the first implant alone and bilateral conditions. A questionnaire measured the pre- to postoperative change in the parent's ratings of the child's performance in specific listening situations. Items were related to speech perception, spatial hearing, or other qualities of hearing. Regular parental reports of device use, attitude and performance were collected. Most subjects were assessed at 6 mo after surgery, with two assessed at 13 mo.Results: The 11 subjects demonstrated a great range of outcomes. For one subject, only anecdotal data were collected. Speech perception testing indicated that when noise was presented ipsilateral to the first implant, 8 of 10 subjects showed a benefit in the bilateral condition. None of the nine subjects tested showed a benefit when noise was contralateral to the first implant. Generally, there was no benefit to localization in the bilateral condition. For eight subjects, postoperative performance ratings were generally higher than preoperative ratings, particularly in the spatial hearing section. Anecdotal reports indicated that most subjects had a negative attitude toward, and gained limited experience with, the second implant alone. The subjects developed a range of speech perception skills, from detection to conversation level. Regarding the use of bilateral implants, attitudes were more positive and device use was consistent for eight subjects, and six parents reported some evidence of improved performance in daily life.Conclusions: Children over age 4 yr may gain significant additional benefit from a second implant, including improved speech perception in some noise contexts and functional advantages in daily life. There is, however, no evidence from this study to suggest that binaural listening skills, including localization, will develop during the first 6 mo. Furthermore, some children who may be committed users of a first implant may not adapt to or benefit from a second implant during the first 6 mo of device use. Although the factors influencing benefit cannot be clearly identified, limited preoperative auditory experience with the second ear, a delay of years between implants, relatively advanced age, and lack of second-implant-alone experience do not preclude benefit. Continued evaluation of these and additional subjects will clarify the factors that do contribute to benefit. Such information will be vital in helping families of implanted children to make an informed decision regarding a second implant."+char(34)+"",

Local field potentials were also used for current source-density analyses. For visual stimulation, phase-reversal gratings of three to five different spatial frequencies and three to five different orientations were presented at the point of central vision. Peripheral visual field was tested using hand-held stimuli (light bar-shaped stimulus of different orientations, moved in different directions and flashed) typically used for neurophysiological characterization of visual fields. From 200 multiunit recordings, no response to visual stimuli could be found in A1 of any of the investigated animals. Using the current source-density analysis of local field potentials, no local generators of field potentials could be found within A1, despite of the presence of small local field potentials. No multiunit responses to somatosensory stimulation (whiskers, face, pinna, head, neck, all paws, back, tail) could be obtained.

The results of Experiment 1 indicated that the timing of developmental changes in visual selective attention was similar for all 3 groups, occurring around 8 years. The magnitude of age-related change differed among groups; hearing children and older deaf children using a cochlear implant reached higher levels of performance with age than did deaf children without enhanced access to sound.

		"Ultrathin, transferred layers of thermally grown silicon dioxide as biofluid barriers for biointegrated flexible electronic systems"+char(34)+"",
		"Materials that can serve as long-lived barriers to biofluids are essential to the development of any type of chronic electronic implant. Devices such as cardiac pacemakers and cochlear implants use bulk metal or ceramic packages as hermetic enclosures for the electronics. Emerging classes of flexible, biointegrated electronic systems demand similar levels of isolation from biofluids but with thin, compliant films that can simultaneously serve as biointerfaces for sensing and/or actuation while in contact with the soft, curved, and moving surfaces of target organs. This paper introduces a solution to this materials challenge that combines (i) ultrathin, pristine layers of silicon dioxide (SiO2) thermally grown on device-grade siliconwafers, and (ii) processing schemes that allow integration of these materials onto flexible electronic platforms. Accelerated lifetime tests suggest robust barrier characteristics on timescales that approach 70 y, in layers that are sufficiently thin (less than 1 mu m) to avoid significant compromises in mechanical flexibility or in electrical interface fidelity. Detailed studies of temperature-and thickness-dependent electrical and physical properties reveal the key characteristics. Molecular simulations highlight essential aspects of the chemistry that governs interactions between the SiO2 and surrounding water. Examples of use with passive and active components in high-performance flexible electronic devices suggest broad utility in advanced chronic implants."+char(34)+"",

		"INTRODUCTION: Severe tinnitus can seriously impair patients in their activities in daily life and reduce their quality of life. The aims of this prospective clinical study were to assess the long-term effects of cochlear implantation (CI) on tinnitus in patients with single-sided deafness and ipsilateral incapacitating tinnitus, and to investigate whether CI could treat various types of tinnitus.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six subjects with unilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss received a CI. Patients suffered from severe tinnitus greater than 6/10 on a visual analogue scale (VAS) due to unilateral deafness. Assessment consisted of a tinnitus analysis including determination of tinnitus type, frequency, and loudness. A tinnitus questionnaire (TQ) measured tinnitus distress. VAS and TQ were administered pre-implantation and postimplantation. RESULTS: All 26 patients reported a subjective benefit from CI. Tinnitus loudness reduced significantly after CI from 8.6 to 2.2 on the VAS (scale: 0-10). The TQ total score decreased significantly and the mean tinnitus degree decreased from severe to mild. No differences were observed between patients with pure-tone tinnitus, narrow band noise tinnitus, or polyphonic tinnitus. The degree of tinnitus loudness reduction remained stable after CI.CONCLUSIONS: CI can successfully be used as treatment of severe tinnitus in patients with single-sided deafness and is equally effective for pure tone, narrow band noise, and polyphonic tinnitus. Long-term results show that implantation provides durable tinnitus relief in these patients. These results support the hypothesis that physiopathological mechanisms after peripheral deafferentation are reversible when hearing is restored. Single-sided deafness accompanied by severe tinnitus is a new indication for CI."+char(34)+"",

		"Factors influencing the efficacy of round window dexamethasone protection of residual hearing postcochlear implant surgery",
		"Aim: To protect hearing in an experimental model of cochlear implantation by the application of dexamethasone to the round window prior to surgery. The present study examined the dosage and timing relationships required to optimise the hearing protection.Methods: Dexamethasone or saline (control) was absorbed into a pledget of the carboxymethylcellulose and hyaluronic acid and applied to the round window of the guinea pig prior to cochlear implantation. The treatment groups were 2% w/v dexamethasone for 30, 60 and 120 min; 20% dexamethasone applied for 30 min. Auditory sensitivity was determined pre-operatively, and at I week after surgery, with pure-tone auditory brainstem response audiometry (2-32 kHz). Cochlear implantation was performed via a cochleostomy drilled into the basal turn of the cochlea, into which a miniature cochlear implant dummy electrode was inserted using soft-surgery techniques.Results: ABR thresholds were elevated after cochlear implantation, maximally at 32 kHz and to a lesser extent at lower frequencies. Thresholds were less elevated after dexamethasone treatment, and the hearing protection improved when 2% dexamethasone was applied to the round window for longer periods of time prior to implantation. The time that dexamethasone need be applied to achieve hearing protection could be reduced by increasing the concentration of steroid, with a 20% application for 30 min achieving similar levels of protection to a 60 min application of 2% dexamethasone.Conclusions: Hearing protection is improved by increasing the time that dexamethasone is applied to the round window prior to cochlear implantation, and the waiting time can be reduced by increasing the steroid concentration. These results suggest that the diffusion dexamethasone through the cochlea is the prime determinant of the extent of hearing protection. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

New developments in this area include the use of functional imaging to investigate tinnitus suppression by cochlear implant stimulation and consideration of a reported worsening effect on tinnitus of binaural implantation. Following work on hearing aids, it is suggested that optimization of the benefit of monaural cochlear implantation on tinnitus in a tinnitus-specific electrode configuration might include the use of a low knee point compression algorithm and disabling directional microphone function: these strategies are potentially also of benefit in patients whose tinnitus results in sleep disturbance.

To test this hypothesis, the authors identified pediatric cochlear implant recipients with gap junction protein beta 2 (GJB2)-related deafness. The study examines performance outcomes associated with GJB2 deafness-causing allele variants. Study Design: Pediatric cochlear implant patients were screened for GJB2 allele variants; statistical comparisons were made with prospectively obtained performance measures. Methods. From 181 children who participated in a nationwide cochlear implant research program, 122 children were identified with congenital non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss and invited to participate. Screening for GJB2 allele variants was completed for 55 children. The children were homogeneous with respect to age (8 or 9 y) and age at implant (before age 5 y). All patients have previously undergone a prospective regimented battery of performance measures. Results: Performance measures were compared between 22 children with and 33 children without mutations to determine whether GJB2 status was a significant predictor of cochlear implant outcomes. Reading and cognitive outcomes were significantly dependent on connexin status. The group of children who tested positive for GJB2-related deafness scored significantly higher on a nonverbal cognitive measure, Block Design, and on a measure of reading comprehension. Conclusion: The isolated insult to the cochlea created by GJB2 allele variants allows for preservation of central cognitive function.

		"Cochlear implantation of auditory neuropathy.",
		"Auditory neuropathy (AN) is a hearing disorder that presents with a grossly abnormal or absent neural response as measured by evoked potentials in the presence of normal outer hair cell function evidenced by present otoacoustic emissions or cochlear microphonics. Rehabilitation for patients with AN is challenging due to abnormal temporal encoding at the auditory nerve leading to severely impaired speech perception. Although patients with AN may demonstrate improvement in thresholds with amplification, temporal encoding dysfunction, and consequently speech perception degradation, is not alleviated by amplification. Another issue is the heterogeneity of the AN population in terms of audiologic and neurologic findings, in addition to uncertain etiology and pathophysiology. For children with prelingual onset of AN, development of auditory and oral communication skills is particularly compromised. All children with hearing loss in the severe-to-profound range who do not benefit from conventional amplification can be considered candidates for a cochlear implant (CI). This paper presents a case study of a child with AN who received a CI. Whereas no synchronous neural response auditory brainstem response could be elicited to acoustic stimuli, an electrically evoked auditory nerve action potential was evident following implantation, suggesting restoration to some degree of neural synchrony. Significant improvement in speech perception was found post-CI. Recommendation to implant all patients with AN would be premature, but these findings suggest that electrical stimulation in some cases of auditory neuropathy can be a viable option."+char(34)+"",

		"The cochlear implant (CI) has been labeled the most successful neural prosthesis. Despite this success, a significant number of CI recipients experience poor speech understanding, and, even among the best performers, restoration to normal auditory fidelity is rare. While significant research efforts have been devoted to improving stimulation strategies, few developments have led to significant hearing improvement over the past two decades. We have recently introduced image processing techniques that open a new direction for advancement in this field by making it possible, for the first time, to determine the position of implanted CI electrodes relative to the nerves they stimulate using computed tomography images. In this article, we present results of an image- guided, patient-customized approach to stimulation that utilizes the electrode position information our image processing techniques provide. This approach allows us to identify electrodes that cause overlapping stimulation patterns and to deactivate them from a patient's map. This individualized mapping strategy yields significant improvement in speech understanding in both quiet and noise as well as improved spectral resolution in the 68 adult CI recipients studied to date. Our results indicate that image guidance can improve hearing outcomes for many existing CI recipients without requiring additional surgery or the use of 'experimental' stimulation strategies, hardware or software.

		"This report highlights research projects relevant to binaural and spatial hearing in adults and children. In the past decade we have made progress in understanding the impact of bilateral cochlear implants (BiCIs) on performance in adults and children. However, BiCI users typically do not perform as well as normal hearing (NH) listeners. In this article we describe the benefits from BiCIs compared with a single cochlear implant (Cl), focusing on measures of spatial hearing and speech understanding in noise. We highlight the fact that in BiCI listening the devices in the two ears are not coordinated; thus binaural spatial cues that are available to NH listeners are not available to BiCI users. Through the use of research processors that carefully control the stimulus delivered to each electrode in each ear, we are able to preserve binaural cues and deliver them with fidelity to BiCI users. Results from those studies are discussed as well, with a focus on the effect of age at onset of deafness and plasticity of binaural sensitivity. Our work with children has expanded both in number of subjects tested and age range included. We have now tested dozens of children ranging in age from 2 to 14 yr. Our findings suggest that spatial hearing abilities emerge with bilateral experience. While we originally focused on studying performance in free field, where real world listening experiments are conducted, more recently we have begun to conduct studies under carefully controlled binaural stimulation conditions with children as well. We have also studied language acquisition and speech perception and production in young Cl users. Finally, a running theme of this research program is the systematic investigation of the numerous factors that contribute to spatial and binaural hearing in BiCI users. By using Cl simulations (with vocoders) and studying NH listeners under degraded listening conditions, we are able to tease apart limitations due to the hardware/software of the Cl systems from limitations due to neural pathology."+char(34)+"",

		"Hearing loss is common in older adults. Patients, clinicians, and health care staff often do not recognize hearing loss, particularly in its early stages, and it is undertreated. Age-related hearing loss or presbycusis, the most common type of hearing loss in older adults, is a multifactorial sensorineural loss that frequently includes a component of impaired speech discrimination. Simple office-based screening and evaluation procedures can identify potential hearing disorders, which should prompt audiologic referral to confirm the diagnosis with audiometric testing. The mainstay of treatment is amplification. For many older adults, accepting the need for amplification, selecting and purchasing a hearing aid, and getting accustomed to its use is a daunting and often frustrating process. There are numerous barriers to hearing aid use, the most common of which is dissatisfaction with its performance across a range of sonic environments. Newer digital hearing aids have many features that improve performance, making them potentially more acceptable to users, but they are expensive and are not covered by Medicare. Hearing aids have been demonstrated to improve hearing function and hearing-related quality of life (QOL), but evidence is less robust for improving overall QOL. Depending upon the etiology of the hearing loss, other medical and surgical procedures, including cochlear implantation, may benefit older adults. Older adults with multiple morbidities and who are frail pose specific challenges for the management of hearing loss. These patients may require integration of hearing assessment and treatment as part of functional assessment in an interdisciplinary, team-based approach to care.

		"Purpose: This study investigated the feasibility and efficacy of a working memory training program for improving memory and language skills in a sample of 9 children who are deaf (age 7-15 years) with cochlear implants (CIs).Method: All children completed the Cogmed Working Memory Training program on a home computer over a 5-week period. Feasibility and acceptability of the program were evaluated using parent report and measures of children's performance on the training exercises. Efficacy measures of working memory and sentence repetition were obtained prior to training, immediately after training, and 1 month and 6 months after training.Results: Children's performance improved on most training exercises, and parents reported no problems with children's hearing or understanding of the exercises. After completion of working memory training, children demonstrated significant improvement on measures of verbal and nonverbal working memory, parent-reported working memory behavior, and sentence-repetition skills. The magnitude of improvement in working memory decreased slightly at the 1-month follow-up and more substantially at 6-month follow-up. However, sentence repetition continued to show marked improvement at 6- month follow-up.Conclusions: Working memory training may produce benefit for somememory and language skills for children with CIs, supporting the importance of conducting a large-scale, randomized clinical trial with this population."+char(34)+"",

		"Comparison of Bimodal and Bilateral Cochlear Implant Users on Speech Recognition With Competing Talker, Music Perception, Affective Prosody Discrimination, and Talker Identification"+char(34)+"",
		"Objectives: Despite excellent performance in speech recognition in quiet, most cochlear implant users have great difficulty with speech recognition in noise, music perception, identifying tone of voice, and discriminating different talkers. This may be partly due to the pitch coding in cochlear implant speech processing. Most current speech processing strategies use only the envelope information; the temporal fine structure is discarded. One way to improve electric pitch perception is to use residual acoustic hearing via a hearing aid on the nonimplanted ear (bimodal hearing). This study aimed to test the hypothesis that bimodal users would perform better than bilateral cochlear implant users on tasks requiring good pitch perception.Design: Four pitch-related tasks were used.1. Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) sentences spoken by a male talker with a competing female, male, or child talker.2. Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia. This is a music test with six subtests examining pitch, rhythm and timing perception, and musical memory.3. Aprosodia Battery. This has five subtests evaluating aspects of affective prosody and recognition of sarcasm.4. Talker identification using vowels spoken by 10 different talkers (three men, three women, two boys, and two girls).Bilateral cochlear implant users were chosen as the comparison group. Thirteen bimodal and 13 bilateral adult cochlear implant users were recruited; all had good speech perception in quiet.Results: There were no significant differences between the mean scores of the bimodal and bilateral groups on any of the tests, although the bimodal group did perform better than the bilateral group on almost all tests. Performance on the different pitch-related tasks was not correlated, meaning that if a subject performed one task well they would not necessarily perform well on another. The correlation between the bimodal users' hearing threshold levels in the aided ear and their performance on these tasks was weak.Conclusions: Although the bimodal cochlear implant group performed better than the bilateral group on most parts of the four pitch-related tests, the differences were not statistically significant. The lack of correlation between test results shows that the tasks used are not simply providing a measure of pitch ability. Even if the bimodal users have better pitch perception, the real-world tasks used are reflecting more diverse skills than pitch. This research adds to the existing speech perception, language, and localization studies that show no significant difference between bimodal and bilateral cochlear implant users."+char(34)+"",

		"Sound Localization Skills in Children Who Use Bilateral Cochlear Implants and in Children With Normal Acoustic Hearing",
		"Objectives: To measure sound source localization in children who have sequential bilateral cochlear implants (BICIs); to determine whether localization accuracy correlates with performance on a rightleft discrimination task (i.e., spatial acuity); to determine whether there is a measurable bilateral benefit on a sound source identification task (i.e., localization accuracy) by comparing performance under bilateral and unilateral listening conditions; and to determine whether sound source localization continues to improve with longer durations of bilateral experience.Design: Two groups of children participated in this study: a group of 21 children who received BICIs in sequential procedures (5 to 14 years) and a group of 7 typically developing children with normal acoustic hearing (5 years). Testing was conducted in a large sound-treated booth with loudspeakers positioned on a horizontal arc with a radius of 1.2 m. Children participated in two experiments that assessed spatial hearing skills. Spatial hearing acuity was assessed with a discrimination task in which listeners determined whether a sound source was presented on the right or left side of center; the smallest angle at which performance on this task was reliably above chance is the minimum audible angle. Sound localization accuracy was assessed with a sound source identification task in which children identified the perceived position of the sound source from a multiloudspeaker array (7 or 15); errors are quantified using the root mean square (RMS) error.Results: Sound localization accuracy was highly variable among the children with BICIs, with RMS errors ranging from 19 to 56 degrees. Performance of the normal hearing group, with RMS errors ranging from 9 to 29 degrees was significantly better. Within the BICI group, in 11 of 21 children, RMS errors were smaller in the bilateral versus unilateral listening condition, indicating bilateral benefit. There was a significant correlation between spatial acuity and sound localization accuracy (R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.01), suggesting that children who achieve small RMS errors tend to have the smallest minimum audible angles. Although there was large intersubject variability, testing of 11 children in the BICI group at two sequential visits revealed a subset of children who show improvement in spatial hearing skills over time.Conclusions: A subset of children who use sequential BICIs can acquire sound localization abilities, even after long intervals between activation of hearing in the first-and second-implanted ears. This suggests that children with activation of the second implant later in life may be capable of developing spatial hearing abilities. The large variability in performance among the children with BICIs suggests that maturation of sound localization abilities in children with BICIs may be dependent on various individual subject factors such as age of implantation and chronological age."+char(34)+"",

		"Impact of Low-Frequency Hearing",
		"Today, cochlear implantation is the treatment of choice in the case of severe to profound hearing loss, but the speech perception abilities of many recipients in noisy conditions are still poor and the overall sound quality and ease of listening still require improvement. Residual low-frequency hearing has been associated with improved hearing performance in cochlear implant patients, especially in difficult listening environments (i.e. cocktail party effect). It seems that low-frequency information can enhance the segregation of competing voices, which leads to better speech understanding in noise. We investigated the effect of low-frequency hearing on speech perception performance in a group of subjects being implanted with the Nucleus Hybrid-L device. The Hybrid-L device is a modified Nucleus Freedom implant, which instead of the standard electrode carries a very delicate electrode array that allows preservation of residual hearing to a great extent. Sentence test results from 22 subjects are presented here. Additionally, for 8 subjects, the acoustically presented frequency range was limited to 300, 500 and 700 Hz, and speech perception tests with a single competing talker were conducted. The Hybrid-L study group achieved a speech reception threshold of 15.9 dB in the hearing aid alone condition, 10.8 dB in the cochlear implant alone condition, and 3.9 dB when using the combination of cochlear implant and hearing aid. Differences between the 3 conditions are statistically significant. Results from the additional experiment on the acoustically presented frequency range suggest that very limited residual hearing below 500 Hz is already sufficient to produce a significant improvement in speech perception performance in conjunction with a cochlear implant.

The effect of varying f(lp) in tone and noise vocoders was investigated for channel numbers, N, from 6 to 18. As N increased, the widths of the channels decreased. The value of f(lp) was 45 Hz (envelope or "+char(34)+"E"+char(34)+" filter), or 180 Hz (pitch or "+char(34)+"P"+char(34)+" filter). The following combinations of cutoff frequencies were used for channels below and above 1500 Hz, respectively: EE, PE, EP, and PP. Results from a competing-talker task showed that the tone vocoder led to better intelligibility than the noise vocoder. The PP condition led to the best intelligibility and the EE condition to the worst. For N=6, intelligibility was better for condition PE than for condition EP. For N= 18, the reverse was true. The results indicate that the.channel bandwidths can compromise the transmission of f0-related envelope information, and suggest that vocoder simulations of cochlearimplant processing have limitations.

		"With today's technology and the demonstrated success of cochlear implantation, along with expanded candidacy criteria, the opportunity to provide optimal hearing to both ears for individuals with severe-to-profound hearing loss is greater than ever. This article reviews the advantages of binaural hearing and the disadvantages of hearing with only one ear or hearing with two ears with significantly different sound thresholds. A case study is presented that demonstrates the benefit of bimodal hearing (i.e., a cochlear implant [CI] in one ear and a contralateral hearing aid [HA]) in a nontraditional CI candidate with asymmetrical hearing thresholds. Then, selected studies in adult recipients who use a CI and contralateral HA or who use two CIs are summarized. The data overall demonstrate that bilateral CI recipients, traditional bimodal recipients, and nontraditional bimodal recipients experience substantial binaural hearing advantages, including improved speech recognition in noise, localization, and functional everyday communication. These results indicate that bilateral stimulation of the auditory system through a Cl and contralateral HA or two CIs is beneficial and should become standard clinical practice."+char(34)+"",

		"Objectives: In this study we aimed to evaluate new bone and new fibrous tissue formation in the inner ear following cochlear implantation.Methods: Twelve temporal bones from patients who underwent cochlear implantation during life were prepared for histologic study. The specimens were reconstructed by both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional methods. These reconstructions were used to calculate the total volume and distribution of new bone and new fibrous tissue in the cochlea, the number of spiral ganglion cells, and other histopathologic parameters. Clinical data, including the last-recorded word recognition scores, were obtained from the patients' medical records.Results: New bone and new fibrous tissue were found in all 12 specimens, particularly at the site of cochleostomy. There was a significant correlation between overall damage to the lateral cochlear wall and the total volume of intracochlear new tissue (Spearman rho = .853; p = .0004). The total volume of new tissue did not correlate with word recognition scores or spiral ganglion cell counts.Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that the degree of damage to the lateral cochlear wall may play an important role in influencing the amount of new tissue formation following cochlear implantation. Intracochlear new tissue does not appear to be an important determinant of performance as measured by word recognition scores or the total number of remaining spiral ganglion cells."+char(34)+"",

		"Objective: The present study sought to document the psycho-social adjustment of 181 school-aged deaf children who have had a cochlear implant for 4 or more yr and to examine parental satisfaction with the outcome of the implantation process on their child's life and on their family's life in general.Design: Three measures were employed. One measure was a self-report instrument designed to assess perceived self-competence in children, one was a rating scale completed by parents that sought to assess the degree of their child's personal-social adjustment, and the third was a questionnaire given to parents on which they rated their satisfaction with aspects of the cochlear implant and how it had affected their child's functioning within the context of family life.Results: Children generally perceived themselves (and parents perceived their children) as being competent and well adjusted in most aspects of daily life. Parents expressed a generally positive view of cochlear implantation and its effects on family life. None of the social-emotional adjustment measures was significantly related to the speech perception, speech production or language skills the child achieved postimplant. However, the parents' satisfaction with their child's cochlear implantation was significantly related to their child's speech and language achievements. On the perceived self-competence instrument, younger children and those with longer use of the updated SPEAK speech processor gave themselves higher ratings. Parent ratings of their child's adjustment tended to be higher for girls than for boys, for more rather than less intelligent children, and for children enrolled in private as opposed to public school settings.Conclusions: Deaf children who have used a cochlear implant for 4 to 6 yr report that they are coping successfully with the demands of their social and school environment, regardless of their speech and language achievements after implantation. Parents' ratings indicate that these children are emotionally and socially well adjusted and that they have benefited from cochlear implantation. To the extent that the children and their parents accurately reported their attitudes and feelings regarding their experiences at home and at school, these results represent an impressive level of personal and social adjustment when compared with previous literature on adjustment problems in deaf children. The extent to which these results are associated with cochlear implantation has not been determined and awaits comparative data from children without implants."+char(34)+"",

		"Visual influences on auditory spatial learning",
		"The visual and auditory systems frequently work together to facilitate the identification and localization of objects and events in the external world. Experience plays a critical role in establishing and maintaining congruent visual-auditory associations, so that the different sensory cues associated with targets that can be both seen and heard are synthesized appropriately. For stimulus location, visual information is normally more accurate and reliable and provides a reference for calibrating the perception of auditory space. During development, vision plays a key role in aligning neural representations of space in the brain, as revealed by the dramatic changes produced in auditory responses when visual inputs are altered, and is used throughout life to resolve short-term spatial conflicts between these modalities. However, accurate, and even supra-normal, auditory localization abilities can be achieved in the absence of vision, and the capacity of the mature brain to relearn to localize sound in the presence of substantially altered auditory spatial cues does not require visuomotor feedback. Thus, while vision is normally used to coordinate information across the senses, the neural circuits responsible for spatial hearing can be recalibrated in a visionindependent fashion. Nevertheless, early multisensory experience appears to be crucial for the emergence of an ability to match signals from different sensory modalities and therefore for the outcome of audiovisual-based rehabilitation of deaf patients in whom hearing has been restored by cochlear implantation."+char(34)+"",

Receipt of a second implant led to improvements in self-reported abilities in spatial hearing, quality of hearing, and hearing for speech, but to generally non-significant changes in measures of quality of life. Multivariate analyses showed that positive changes in quality of life were associated with improvements in hearing, but were offset by negative changes associated with worsening tinnitus. Even in a best-case scenario, in which no worsening of tinnitus was assumed to occur, the gain in quality of life was too small to achieve an acceptable cost-effectiveness ratio.

The primary objective of this study was to compare select acoustic characteristics of the speech of deaf children who use cochlear implants (young cochlear implant users) with those of children with normal hearing. A secondary objective of this study was to examine the effect, if any, of the deaf child's education (oral versus total communication) on the similarity of these acoustic characteristics to those of normal-hearing age-mates.Design: Speech was recorded from 181 young cochlear implant users and from 24 children with normal hearing. All speech was produced by imitation, and consisted of complete sentences. Acoustic measures included voice onset time (/t/, /d/), second formant frequency (/i/, /o/), spectral moments (mean, skew and kurtosis of /s/ and /f/), a nasal manner metric, and durations (of vowels, words, and sentences).Results and Discussion: A large percentage (46 to 97%) of the young cochlear implant users produced acoustic characteristics with values within the range found for children with normal hearing. Exceptions were sentence duration and vowel duration in sentence-initial words, for which only 23 and 25%, respectively, of the cochlear implant users had values within the normal range. Additionally, for most of the acoustic measures, significantly more cochlear implant users from oral than from total communication settings had values within the normal range.Conclusions: Compared with deaf children with hearing aids (from previous studies by others), deaf children who use cochlear implants have improved speech production skills, as reflected in the acoustic measures of this study. Placement in an oral communication educational setting is also associated with more speech production improvement than placement in a total communication setting."+char(34)+"",
